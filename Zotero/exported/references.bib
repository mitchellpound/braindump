  abstract = {Market Models provides an authoritative and up-to-date treatment of the use of market data to develop models for financial analysis. Written by a leading figure in the field of financial data analysis, this book is the first of its kind to address the vital techniques required for model selection and development. Model developers are faced with many decisions, about the pricing, the data, the statistical methodology and the calibration and testing of the model prior to implementation. It is important to make the right choices and Carol Alexander's clear exposition provides valuable insights at every stage.  In each of the 13 Chapters, Market Models presents real world illustrations to motivate theoretical developments. The accompanying CD contains spreadsheets with data and programs; this enables you to implement and adapt many of the examples. The pricing of options using normal mixture density functions to model returns; the use of Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the VaR of an options portfolio; modifying the covariance VaR to allow for fat-tailed P\&L distributions; the calculation of implied, EWMA and 'historic' volatilities; GARCH volatility term structure forecasting; principal components analysis; and many more are all included.  Carol Alexander brings many new insights to the pricing and hedging of options with her understanding of volatility and correlation, and the uncertainty which surrounds these key determinants of option portfolio risk. Modelling the market risk of portfolios is covered where the main focus is on a linear algebraic approach; the covariance matrix and principal component analysis are developed as key tools for the analysis of financial systems. The traditional time series econometric approach is also explained with coverage ranging from the application cointegration to long-short equity hedge funds, to high-frequency data prediction using neural networks and nearest neighbour algorithms.  Throughout this text the emphasis is on understanding concepts and implementing solutions. It has been designed to be accessible to a very wide audience: the coverage is comprehensive and complete and the technical appendix makes the book largely self-contained.  Market Models: A Guide to Financial Data Analysis is the ideal reference for all those involved in market risk measurement, quantitative trading and investment analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates whether agents can learn how to form rational expectations using standard econometric techniques in the case of a linear stochastic supply and demand model with a production lag. This model has a unique rational expectations equilibrium in which the expected price is a linear function of an observable exogenous random variable. Outside of rational expectations equilibrium agents predict the price by using a regression of past prices on the exogenous random variable where the regression is estimated by either ordinary least squares or Bayesian methods. If the agents are Bayesians, they may have diverse prior beliefs on the mean of the estimated parameter, but all have the same precision. This estimation procedure would be appropriate for an outside observer estimating the parameters of the model in rational expectations equilibrium the coefficient of the equation relating the mathematical conditional expectation of the price to the exogenous variable is constant through time. Outside rational expectations equilibrium this coefficient, which changes each time new data change the regression coefficient. The data are generated by a time-varying parameter model where the varying parameter is determined by past data and the estimation procedure. Agents fail to take this feedback into account and so are estimating a misspecific model.},

  abstract = {Bayesian networks (BNs) are increasingly being used to model environmental systems, in order to: integrate multiple issues and system components; utilise information from different sources; and handle missing data and uncertainty. BNs also have a modular architecture that facilitates iterative model development. For a model to be of value in generating and sharing knowledge or providing decision support, it must be built using good modelling practice. This paper provides guidelines to developing and evaluating Bayesian network models of environmental systems, and presents a case study habitat suitability model for juvenile Astacopsis gouldi, the giant freshwater crayfish of Tasmania. The guidelines entail clearly defining the model objectives and scope, and using a conceptual model of the system to form the structure of the BN, which should be parsimonious yet capture all key components and processes. After the states and conditional probabilities of all variables are defined, the BN should be assessed by a suite of quantitative and qualitative forms of model evaluation. All the assumptions, uncertainties, descriptions and reasoning for each node and linkage, data and information sources, and evaluation results must be clearly documented. Following these standards will enable the modelling process and the model itself to be transparent, credible and robust, within its given limitations.},

  abstract = {Value at risk (or âVARâ) is a method of measuring the financial risk of an asset, portfolio, or exposure over some specified period of time. By facilitating the consistent measurement of risk across different assets and activities, VAR allows companies to monitor, report, and control their risks in a manner that efficiently relates risk control to desired and actual economic exposures. Nevertheless, reliance on VAR can result in serious problems when improperly used, and would-be users of VAR are advised to consider the following three pieces of advice: âª First, VAR is a tool for firms engaged in total value risk management. Companies concerned not with the value of a stock of assets and liabilities over a specific time horizon, but rather with the volatility of a flow of funds, are often better off eschewing VAR altogether in favor of a measure of cash flow volatility. âª Second, VAR should be applied very carefully to companies that practice âselectiveâ risk management those firms that choose to take certain risks as a part of their primary business. When VAR is reported in such situations without estimates of corresponding expected profits, the information conveyed by the VAR estimate can be extremely misleading. âª Third, as a number of recent derivatives disasters are used to illustrate, no form of risk measurement including VARâis a substitute for good management. Risk management as a process encompasses much more than just risk measurement. Indeed, risk measurement (whether using VAR or some of the alternatives proposed in this article) is pointless without a well-developed organizational infrastructure and IT system capable of supporting the complex and dynamic process of risk taking and risk control.},

  abstract = {This monograph attempts a theory of every 'thing' that can be distinguished from other things in a statistical sense. The ensuing statistical independencies, mediated by Markov blankets, speak to a recursive composition of ensembles (of things) at increasingly higher spatiotemporal scales. This decomposition provides a description of small things; e.g., quantum mechanics - via the Schrodinger equation, ensembles of small things - via statistical mechanics and related fluctuation theorems, through to big things - via classical mechanics. These descriptions are complemented with a Bayesian mechanics for autonomous or active things. Although this work provides a formulation of every thing, its main contribution is to examine the implications of Markov blankets for self-organisation to nonequilibrium steady-state. In brief, we recover an information geometry and accompanying free energy principle that allows one to interpret the internal states of something as representing or making inferences about its external states. The ensuing Bayesian mechanics is compatible with quantum, statistical and classical mechanics and may offer a formal description of lifelike particles.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning: Discriminative and Generative covers the main contemporary themes and tools in machine learning ranging from Bayesian probabilistic models to discriminative support-vector machines. However, unlike previous books that only discuss these rather different approaches in isolation, it bridges the two schools of thought together within a common framework, elegantly connecting their various theories and making one common big-picture. Also, this bridge brings forth new hybrid discriminative-generative tools that combine the strengths of both camps. This book serves multiple purposes as well. The framework acts as a scientific breakthrough, fusing the areas of generative and discriminative learning and will be of interest to many researchers. However, as a conceptual breakthrough, this common framework unifies many previously unrelated tools and techniques and makes them understandable to a larger portion of the public. This gives the more practical-minded engineer, student and the industrial public an easy-access and more sensible road map into the world of machine learning.  Machine Learning: Discriminative and Generative is designed for an audience composed of researchers \& practitioners in industry and academia. The book is also suitable as a secondary text for graduate-level students in computer science and engineering.},

In economic environments where preferences may be assumed to be convex and money is available as a medium of exchange, no-arbitrage supports the concepts of subjective expected utility maximization in personal decisions, competitive equilibria in capital markets and exchange economies, and correlated equilibria in noncooperative games. The arbitrage principle directly characterizes rationality at the market level; apparent optimizing behavior by individual agents is viewed as a consequence of their adaptation to the market. Concepts of equilibrium behavior in games and markets can thus be reconciled with the ideas that individual rationality is bounded, that agents use evolutionarily-shaped decision rules rather than numerical optimization algorithms, and that personal probabilities and utilities are inseparable and to some extent indeterminate. Risk-neutral probability distributions, interpretable as products of probabilities and marginal utilities, play a central role as observable quantities in economic systems.},

  abstract = {De Finetti's treatise on the theory of probability begins with the provocative statement PROBABILITY DOES NOT EXIST, meaning that probability does not exist in an objective sense. Rather, probability exists only subjectively within the minds of individuals. De Finetti defined subjective probabilities in terms of the rates at which individuals are willing to bet money on events, even though, in principle, such betting rates could depend on state-dependent marginal utility for money as well as on beliefs. Most later authors, from Savage onward, have attempted to disentangle beliefs from values by introducing hypothetical bets whose payoffs are abstract consequences that are assumed to have state-independent utility. In this paper, I argue that de Finetti was right all along: PROBABILITY, considered as a numerical measure of pure belief uncontaminated by attitudes toward money, does not exist. Rather, what exist are de Finetti's `previsions', or betting rates for money, otherwise known in the literature as `risk neutral probabilities'. But the fact that previsions are not measures of pure belief turns out not to be problematic for statistical inference, decision analysis, or economic modeling.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the relationship between thermodynamics, information and inference. In particular, it explores the thermodynamic concomitants of belief updating, under a variational (free energy) principle for self-organization. In brief, any (weakly mixing) random dynamical system that possesses a Markov blanketâi.e. a separation of internal and external statesâis equipped with an information geometry. This means that internal states parametrize a probability density over external states. Furthermore, at non-equilibrium steady-state, the flow of internal states can be construed as a gradient flow on a quantity known in statistics as Bayesian model evidence. In short, there is a natural Bayesian mechanics for any system that possesses a Markov blanket. Crucially, this means that there is an explicit link between the inference performed by internal states and their energeticsâas characterized by their stochastic thermodynamics. This article is part of the theme issue âHarmonizing energy-autonomous computing and intelligenceâ.},

[(2009) Bayesian Anal 3:427â442] advocated the use of ABC for model choice in the specific case of Gibbs random fields, relying on an intermodel sufficiency property to show that the approximation was legitimate. We implemented ABC model choice in a wide range of phylogenetic models in the Do It Yourself-ABC (DIY-ABC) software [Cornuet et al. (2008) Bioinformatics 24:2713â2719]. We now present arguments as to why the theoretical arguments for ABC model choice are missing, because the algorithm involves an unknown loss of information induced by the use of insufficient summary statistics. The approximation error of the posterior probabilities of the models under comparison may thus be unrelated with the computational effort spent in running an ABC algorithm. We then conclude that additional empirical verifications of the performances of the ABC procedure as those available in DIY-ABC are necessary to conduct model choice.},

A decision maker (DM) faces an objective long-run probability distribution p over several variables (including the action taken by previous DMs). The DM is characterized by a subjective causal model, represented by a directed acyclic graph over the set of variable labels. The DM attempts to fit this model to p , resulting in a subjective belief that distorts p by factorizing it according to the graph via the standard Bayesian network formula. As a result of this belief distortion, the DMâs evaluation of actions can vary with their long-run frequencies. Accordingly, I define a âpersonal equilibriumâ notion of individual behavior. The framework enables simple graphical representations of causal-attribution errors (such as coarseness or reverse causation), and provides tools for checking rationality properties of the DMâs behavior. I demonstrate the frameworkâs scope of applications with examples covering diverse areas, from demand for education to public policy.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a theory of corporate risk management that goes beyond the âvariance-minimizationâ model that long dominated academic discussions of the subject. It argues that the primary goal of risk management is not to dampen swings in corporate earnings, cash flows, or value, but rather to provide protection against the possibility of costly lower-tail outcomesâsituations that would cause financial distress or make a company unable to carry out its investment strategy. In the jargon of finance specialists, risk management can be viewed as the purchase of âwell-out-of-the-money put optionsâ designed to limit downside risk. By eliminating downside risk and reducing the expected costs of financial trouble, risk management can also help a company to achieve both its value-maximizing capital structure and its optimal ownership structure. For besides increasing corporate debt capacity, the reduction of downside risk also encourages larger equity stakes for managers by shielding their investments from âuncontrollables.â The paper also departs from standard finance theory in suggesting that some companies may have a comparative advantage in bearing certain financial market risksâan advantage that derives from information acquired through their normal business activities. Although such specialized information may lead some companies to take speculative positions in commodities or currencies, it is more likely to encourage âselectiveâ hedging, a practice in which the risk manager's âviewâ of future price movements influences the percentage of the exposure that is hedged. But to the extent that such view-taking becomes an accepted part of a company's risk management program, it is important to evaluate managersâ bets on a risk-adjusted basis and relative to the market. If risk managers want to behave like money managers, they should be evaluated like money managers.},

  abstract = {This fully updated new edition of a uniquely accessible textbook/reference provides a general introduction to probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) from an engineering perspective.~ It features new material on partially observable Markov decision processes, causal graphical models, causal discovery and deep learning, as well as an even greater number of exercises; it also incorporates a software library for several graphical models in Python.The book covers the fundamentals for each of the main classes of PGMs, including representation, inference and learning principles, and reviews real-world applications for each type of model. These applications are drawn from a broad range of disciplines, highlighting the many uses of Bayesian classifiers, hidden Markov models, Bayesian networks, dynamic and temporal Bayesian networks, Markov random fields, influence diagrams, and Markov decision processes.Topics and features:Presents a unified framework encompassing all of the main classes of PGMsExplores the fundamental aspects of representation, inference and learning for each techniqueExamines new material on partially observable Markov decision processes, and graphical modelsIncludes~a new chapter introducing deep neural networks and their relation with probabilistic graphical models~Covers multidimensional Bayesian classifiers, relational graphical models, and causal modelsProvides substantial chapter-ending exercises, suggestions for further reading, and ideas for research or programming projectsDescribes classifiers such as Gaussian Naive Bayes,~Circular Chain Classifiers, and Hierarchical Classifiers with Bayesian NetworksOutlines the practical application of the different techniquesSuggests possible course outlines for instructorsThis classroom-tested work is suitable as a textbook for an advanced undergraduate or a graduate course in probabilistic graphical models for students of computer science, engineering, and physics.
