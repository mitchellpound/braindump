# Literature Notes
The term "free energy principle" (FEP) is getting misused and contributing to _reification_ of models. 

Models come with a structure and construal. 
Structure - actual math + math system that is involved
Construal - interpretation about what the math means

Models $\neq$ Real world
analogy $\neq$ literal meaning
Model framework $\neq$ A theory - its a formalism to talk about a theory

The history of the FEP comes from scientists talking about physical properties, then to analogies of statistics that act like physical properties, to eventually biological/ systems using the statistics (that acted like physical properties). 

Critics say that there is no reason we should simply accept that the FEP is what a system does, or that it doesn't "represent" what is actually going on. Andrews argues this is a feature not a bug. Math is itself meaningless unless you attach it to an interpretation. 

Scientists need to be careful to 
1. Refer to the model as a "FEP model" and not the real world 
2. Separate what the model says from knowledge of the real world - a model must be validated to match predictions to experimental evidence.
