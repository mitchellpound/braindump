# Literature Notes

Compares generative and discriminative models, by computing classification using both and compares the model error and convergence of each. 

Most of the time people prefer discriminative. A lot of times the asymptotic error for a generative model is higher. However, generative models can converge to the asymptotic error faster, so given little data the generative model might be better.
