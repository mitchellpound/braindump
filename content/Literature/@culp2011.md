# Literature Notes
## Apendix 
Gives a brief overview of economics history of thought:
- Classical period - Thought that production was dependent completely on outside factors like land, knowledge, capital, labor, etc... (as opposed to internal human creativity)
- Neoclassical - Looked a lot on the margin. When "in equilibrium" what is the utility/ cost/ etc. of one additional widget? Did not say how markets get to equilibrium other than Walras' actioneer. 
- Austrians - The market is a process, not a state of the economy at one point in time.
