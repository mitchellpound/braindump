# Monte Carlo Markov chain
A way to [[202306131050|Simulating distribution]] using [[202306161624|Markov chain]]. 

The general idea is to find a Markov chain that converges to a stationary distribution, then after sampling the chain for large n times then each realization of the chain is a realization from the stationary distribution.
