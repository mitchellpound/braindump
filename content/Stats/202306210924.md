# variational free energy
Is a functional of the mental model (probability distribution) $Q(x)$ used and the (choice of) data observed $y$.

Has three different, equivalent decompositions

$$
\begin{align*}
	F[Q,y] &= -\mathbb{E}_{Q(x)}[\ln P(y,x)] - H[Q(x)] \\
	&= D_{KL}[Q(x)||P(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{Q(x)}[\ln P(y|x)] \\
	&=  D_{KL}[Q(x)||P(x|y)] - \ln P(y)
\end{align*}
$$
