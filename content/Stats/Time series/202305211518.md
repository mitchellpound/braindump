# Autocovariance 
s-th order autocovariance of $\{y_t\}$ is defined by the unconditional covariance of $y_t$ and $y_{t-s}$ 

$$
cov(y_t, y_{t-s}) = E\big[\big(y_t - E(y_t)\big)\big(y_{t-s} - E(y_{t-s})\big)\big]
$$
Has to do with how a series is related to a lagged version to itself. Helps to find periodic patterns.
