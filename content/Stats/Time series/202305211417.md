# Stationary time series
Weak stationarity, the most common type. The expected value (mean), variance, and autocovariance stay the same for the entire time series. 

$E(y_t) = c_1 < \infty$  
$Var(y_t) = c_2 < \infty$ 
$Cov(y_t,y_{t-s}) = c_3< \infty$ - Doesn't depend on t - just s (the lag). So is constant for fixed s.
