# Rejection sampling
An algorithm to sample from a distribution $f_X(x)$ 

#### Assumptions:
- Need a bounding distribution $g_X(x)$ that you can sample from easily
- The ratio of the functions is bounded, so $\frac{f_X(x)}{g_X(x)} \leq M \leq \infty$
- Define $h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)M}$ 

#### Algorithm
1. Generate some realization y from $g_X(x)$
2. Find $h(y)$ 
3. Sample $u$ from $U[0,1]$
4. If $u<h(y)$, accept $y$
	If $u \geq h(y)$, reject $y$

The $\{accepted \ y\} \sim f$ - they are realizations of f
