# Likelihood ratio vs. Bayes factor
The [[202306071312|Likelihood ratio]] uses the [[202306071208|Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE)]] and subs it in for to find the max probabilities of each model. So it uses a point estimate and doesn't take into account possible unknowns about the parameter

The [[202306071300|Bayes Factor]] integrates across the entire $\Theta$ space so it takes the (weighted) average of different probabilities of $\theta$'s.
