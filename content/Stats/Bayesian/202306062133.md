# Posterior Predictive Distribution

Given the model and the data, what would we expect another realization of the data to look like (statistically)?

$$ p(\tilde{y}|y^{obs}) = \int_\theta p(\tilde{y}|y^{obs}, \theta)p(\theta|y^{obs}) \ d\theta $$

Is similar to the [[202306061642|Predictive distribution]], but it has the extra conditioning factor $y^{obs}$
