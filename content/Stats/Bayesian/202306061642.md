# Predictive distribution
Is the probability of what the data _should_ look like (theoretically and independent of it being sampled) 

Is based off the prior distribution. 

$$ p(y) = \int_\theta p(y|\theta)p(\theta) \ d\theta$$
A lot of times it's easier to sample this a bunch of times to get the distribution instead of trying to do the integration analytically.
