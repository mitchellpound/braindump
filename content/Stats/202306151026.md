# Generative model
A type of statistical model where the researcher estimates a 'general' joint probability distribution 

$$P(X,Y)$$
Where $X$ is the inputs (or hidden states) and $Y$ is the outputs or labels. 

Once this joint probability function is determined, Bayes theorem can be used 
$$P(Y|X) = \frac{P(X,Y)}{P(X)} = \frac{P(X|Y)P(Y)}{P(X)}$$

Then in order to make the prediction the chose the label Y with the highest conditional probability
