# surprise (statistical)
The negative log of evidence

$$ -ln(P(\underline y)) $$
Note that $0 \leq P(\underline y) \leq 1$, so surprise will always be positive when $P(\underline y) \neq 1$. There is no surprise when there is certainty. 

Surprise represents how well (or bad) a model predicts data. A bad model will have a low probability associated with evidence and the surprise will be large.
