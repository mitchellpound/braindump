# Definition
Let $M$ be a [[20231220133911-topology|topological space]] with an open cover $(X_\alpha)_{\alpha \in A}$. 
A **paritition of unity subordinate to $(X_\alpha)$** is a family of continuous functions 
$$
(\psi_\alpha)_{\alpha \in A} \qquad \psi_\alpha :M \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$
with the following properties:
1. $0 \leq \psi_\alpha \leq 1$ for all $\alpha \in A$ and all $x \in M$. 

2. $\{\text{supp} \ \psi_a \subset X_\alpha\}$ for each $\alpha \in A$. (Outside the open set $X_\alpha$, the function is 0). 

3. $\{\text{supp } \psi_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ is locally finite. (Each point in $M$ has a neighborhood that intersects with finitely many non-zero $\psi_\alpha$ non-zero.)

4. $\sum_{\alpha \in A} \psi_\alpha(x) = 1$ for all $x \in M$. 


> [!NOTE] Smooth partition of unity
> If $M$ is a [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]], then each of the functions $\psi_\alpha$ must be smooth. 

# Why care?
Partitions of unity give a good way to "glue" structures together on smooth manifolds. 
Since $\sum \psi_\alpha = 1$ then "multiplying" by a structure will allow us to (informally) spread it around open sets but ensure that it won't be changed on the open set that it is defined on. 

# Partitions of unity exist
Given an open cover $\{V_\alpha\}$ of a smooth manifold $M$, there exists a partition of unity $\{\psi_\alpha\}$ subordinate to $\{V_\alpha\}$. 

## Proof
The proof uses the existence of certain "bump" functions on $\mathbb{R}$. 
Consider the function 
$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
\exp(-\frac{1}{x-a} + \frac{1}{x-b}) & a < x < b\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
which looks like this:
```tikz
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{pgfplots}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    domain=-2:2,
    samples=100,
    xmin=-2, xmax=2, ymin=0, ymax=1.1,
    axis lines=middle,
    axis y line=none,
    xtick={-1,1},  % Custom x-axis markers
    xticklabels={$a$, $b$},  % Custom labels for the x-axis 
    ytick=\empty,
    smooth,
    thick,
  ]
    % Define the bump function in the form of e^(-1/(1 - x^2)) for |x| < 1
    \addplot[
      blue,
      domain=-1:1
    ]
    {exp(-1/(1 - x^2))};
    
    % Draw the zero regions outside the bump interval
    \addplot[
      blue,
      domain=-2:-1
    ]
    {0};
    \addplot[
      blue,
      domain=1:2
    ]
    {0};
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
```

We can use this to 
#todo 
Since a smooth manifold $M$ is paracompact, we can find a locally finite countable refinement $\{B_i\}$
