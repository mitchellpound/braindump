# Definition
Since [[202410111234|affine connections]] are local, then it makes sense to talk about them in relation to local coordinates. 
Let $x:W \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be local coordinates on an open set $W \subset M$.
The **Christoffel symbols** are defined by 
$$
\nabla_{\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j} = \Gamma_{ij}^k \frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}
$$
