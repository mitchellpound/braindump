# choice architecture active inference
How options/ choices/ opportunites are presented determines how people percieve and choose to react to them. This does not change a person's prior beliefs or preferences. 

Conversely, it will determine how the likelihood function interacts with the prior. Different choice architectures represent different likelihood functions or different 'generating processes' that generate _perceptions_ in the active inference paradigm. Thus, even presentations with the same state space for the options can elicit different _actions_ from agents.
