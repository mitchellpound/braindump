# entrepreneurship and active inference
High's version of entrepreneurship and the process of development of institutions relies on "awareness" or "observation" after which the members of society must "make a judgement". [[@high2009]]

This is very similar to active inference. Observations are the observed factors $\tilde o$ or $\tilde y$. Then the judgements are the inversal of the generative model to get to the posterior - namely the state of is this a good practice or not.
