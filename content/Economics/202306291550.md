# models and knowledge
Knowledge is somewhat squishy. Knowledge (pure knowledge) is our brain (or soul... I'm not sure which) attempting to make meaning of the complexity of everything around it. 

Models cannot in themselves give us knowledge. They can be tools to offer insights so we can gain knowledge, but they are themselves meaningless. **WE (HUMANS/BRAINS/TRUTH-SEEKING SOULS)** gain knowledge by comparing evidence/ experiences (experiments) with models and their interpretations, **WE** then must extract the truth from the combination of the model and the evidence. 

Connected to reification of models such as the FEP [[@andrews2021]]
Is the same thing Buchanan and Hayek cautioned against, that economists were confusing their models with the real world and not understanding the limitations [[@buchanan1964]], [[@hayek1937]]
