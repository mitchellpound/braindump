# synthetic refining strategy
Strategy using futures contracts.
- Long on crude oil
- Short on refined oil products

Acts like you are refining oil, since you have the obligation to pay a set price for crude oil then deliver some sort of product that comes from the refining process. So the firm never actually refines the oil, but gets the profits as if they did.
