# Neoclassical Equilibrium
Neoclassical equilibrium can be simply stated as the state when supply equals demand. Mathematically this can be thought of as a fixed point, which implies a rest point where things are not changing in the market. Thus, prices only change due to shifts that change the equilibrium. 

Generally, disequilibrium is seen as boring or a state not worth studying since markets won't clear, and nothing will be sold. [[@culp2011]]
