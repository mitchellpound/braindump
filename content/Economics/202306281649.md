# dynamic choice set
Per Buchanan ([[@buchanan1979]]) via Shackle, humans plan actions based on an unknowable future but of _imaginable_ possibilities. 

This relates to active inference through (hidden) control states ([[@friston2012]]) that might or might not represent an action that an organism (agent) can actually perform. This also means that the action set $A$ must not only be different per person, it also must be dynamic intertemporally - as an agent imagines more possibilities they enter the action set
