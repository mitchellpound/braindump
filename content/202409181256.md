Neotherian rings are important structures that arise in algebraic-geometric settings. 
# Definition
A [[202404171457|ring]] is **left (right) Noetherian** if every left (right) [[202409172306|ideal]] is finitely generated. 
It is called **Noetherian** if it is both left and right Noetherian. Note this is true of any left or right Noetherian ring in the commutative case. 

# Equivalent definition
Let $R$ be a ring. $R$ is (left, right) Noetherian if and only if every chain of (left, right) ideals stabilizer. 
That is, if 
$$
I_1 \subset I_2 \subset \dots \subset R
$$
is a chain of ideals then $I_n = I_{n+1} = \cdots$ for some $n$. 

## Proof
This proof is only for the commutative case, but the same idea applies. 

Consider a chain of ideals
$$
I_1 \subset I_2 \subset \dots
$$
