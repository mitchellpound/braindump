If you stumble across this somehow, welcome!

This is my mind tangle, a tangle of notes, thoughts, and ideas on a variety of topics. 
My personal philosophy on learning is that connection defines learning (not memorization).
Ideas should not be put into boxes or silos, instead should be allowed to flow into other ideas.

On a side note, all errors are mine, but if you don't like it, don't look at it ðŸ˜‰. 

Note to any random person that's not me, the Zotero links in the literature notes will not work since I've set them up for my personal system :)

Here's a few good starting points:
