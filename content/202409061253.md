# Statement
Let $G$ be a compact, connected [[202405061454|Lie group]] with [[202405062209|Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$, and let $(M, \omega, G, \mu)$ be a [[202405231432|Hamiltonian G-space]]
(i.e. $M$ is a [[202404062124|symplectic manifold]] equipped with a [[symplectic action]] of $G$ and an [[202405231417|equivariant]] [[202405231409|moment map]] $\mu:M \to \mathfrak{g}^{*}$).
Suppose for $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}^{*}$, $G_{\xi}$ acts freely on the manifold $\mu^{-1}(\xi)$. Then there is a unique symplectic form $\omega_{\mu}$ on $\mu^{-1}/G_{\xi}$ such that
$$
\pi^{*}\omega_{\mu} = \iota^{*}\omega
$$
where $\pi:\mu^{-1}(\xi)$ is the projection onto the quotient manifold and $\iota:\mu^{-1}(\xi) \to M$ is the inclusion.

In this way,
$$
M //_{\xi} G \coloneqq \mu^{-1}(\xi) / G_{\xi}
$$
is a symplectic manifold and is called the **symplectic or Marsden-Weinstein quotient**.

>[!NOTE] Generalizations
>There are some small generalizations that could be made the hypotheses of the theorem (for example that the Lie group is not compact but that the action is proper), but this is the version I need for my current research, so I'm sticking with compactness.
