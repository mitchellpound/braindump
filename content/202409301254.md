# Definition
Let $R$ be a [[202404171457|ring]]. 
A (left) **$R$-module** is an [[202409301257|action]] of $R$ on an [[202407080915|abelian group]] $M$. 
More explicitly, this means that an $R$-module $M$, (equivalently a left action of a ring $R$ on $M$) is a homomorhphism of rings 
$$
\sigma:R \longrightarrow \text{End}_{\text{Ab}}(M)
$$

## Equivalent definition
Even more explicitly, any homomorphism of rings $\sigma$ as defined above will have the following properties. 
This can be taken as the definition as well.

Let 
$$
\rho:R \times M \longrightarrow M
$$
satisfying the requirements:
- $\rho(r, m+n)= \rho(r,m) + \rho(r,n)$

- $\rho(r + s,m) = \rho(r, m) + \rho(s,m)$ 

- $\rho(rs,m) = \rho(r, \rho(s,m))$ 

- $\rho(1,m) = m$
