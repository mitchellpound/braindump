# Statement
Let $M$ be a finitely generated $R$-[[202409182227|module]] and $I \subset R$ an [[202409172306|ideal]] which is contained in the [[202501101304|Jacobson radical]].
Then $M=0$ if and only if $IM =M$.

## Proof
If $M = 0$ then $IM = M = 0$ trivially.  
Let $IM = M$ satisfying the conditions above. 
Since $M$ is finitely generated, let $\{m_1, \dots, m_n\}$ be a minimal set of generators. 
Because $IM = M$ then 
$$
m_1 = \sum_{j=1}^n i_jm_j \qquad i_j \in I.
$$
Rearranging terms gives
$$
\begin{align*}
m_1 &= i_1m_1 + \sum_{j=2}^n i_jm_j \\
(1-i_1)m_1 &= \sum_{j=2}^n i_jm_j
\end{align*}
$$
Since $I$ is contained in the Jacobson radical, $(1-i_1)$ is a unit so 
$$
m_1 = (1-i_m)\sum_{j=2}^n i_jm_j
$$
which contradicts the assumption that $\{m_1, \dots, m_n\}$ is a minimal generating set.
Hence, $M = 0$.
