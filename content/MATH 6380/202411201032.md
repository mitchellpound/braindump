# Definition
Let $M$ be a finitely generated [[202410091156|torsion]] $k[x]$-[[202409182227|module]] for a [[202404171508|field]] $k$. 
Note that $M$ is equivalent to a vector space with an accompanying endomorphism as explained [[202411181059|here]].

The **minimal polynomial** of $M$ is the monic polynomial $q_M \in k[x]$ which generates the kernel of the ring homomorphism 
$$
k[x] \longrightarrow \text{End}_{\text{ab}}(M)
$$

# Cyclic modules and companion matrices
Let $M$ be a cyclic with generator $m \in M$. 
Then $M$ is spanned (over $k$) by $\{m, Xm, X^2m, \dots \}$. 
We can write the minimal polynomial as 
$$
q_M(x) = x^d + a_{d-1}x^{d-1} + \dots + a_1x + a_0, \qquad a_i \in k.
$$

Using this we can see that $\{m, Xm, X^2m, \dots, X^{d-1}m\}$ is a $k$-basis for $M$. 
This can be seen to be linearly independent using the minimal polynomial and is spanning using the division algorithm. 

Using the ordered basis $\{v_i = X^im \ | \ 0 \leq i \leq d-1\}$, we have 
$$
Xv_i = v_{i+1}, \qquad 0 \leq i \leq d-2
$$
and for the top level degree, it "wraps around" and relates back to the minimal polynomial
$$
Xv_{d-1} = -a_0v_0 - a_1v_1 - \dots - a_{d-1}v_{d-1}
$$
This gives that 
$$
C_{q_M}=\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \cdots & & \cdots&0 &-a_0 \\
1 & \ddots & &&\vdots&\vdots\\
0 & \ddots & & \ddots &\vdots& \vdots\\
\vdots &\ddots & &\ddots&0 &-a_{d-2}\\
0 & \cdots && 0 & 1 & -a_{d-1}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$C_{q_M}$ is called the **companion matrix** of $q_M$.
