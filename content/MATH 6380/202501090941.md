# Definition
A [[202407080919|complex]] $(M_\bullet, f_\bullet)$ is **exact** if its [[202407080925|homology]] $H_\bullet(M_\bullet, f_\bullet) = 0$.

## What does that mean?
A complex is exact if and only if $\text{im } f_{i+1} = \ker f_i$ for all $i$. 
So we have the following simple cases

- $0 \to U \xrightarrow{i} M$  is exact if and only if $i$ is injective.
- $M \xrightarrow{\pi} N \to 0$ is exact if and only if $\pi$ is surjective.
- $0 \to U \xrightarrow{i} M \xrightarrow{\pi} N \to 0$ is exact if and only if $i$ is injective with cokernel $\pi$ and $\pi$ is surjective with kernel $i$. An exact complex of this form is called a [[202411121350|short exact sequence]]. 

# Example
Any morphism of [[202409301254|R-modules]] $f:M \to N$ fits into an exact complex 
$$
0 \longrightarrow \ker f \longrightarrow M \xrightarrow{\,\ f \,\ } N \longrightarrow \text{coker }f \longrightarrow 0
$$
