# Definition
Let $M$ be an [[202409301254|R-module]].
$M$ is called **cyclic** if it is [[202410091049|generated]] by a single element $m \in M$.

# Relation to ideals of ring
$M$ is cyclic if and only if it is isomorphic to $R / I$ for some left [[202409172306|ideal]] $I \subset R$. 

## Proof
Assume $M$ is cyclic, so $M = \langle m \rangle$.   
Then we can look at the $R$-module homomorphism
$$
\begin{align*}
f:R &\longrightarrow M \\
r &\longmapsto rm
\end{align*}
$$
since $M = \langle m \rangle$, this is surjective. 
Thus, by the first isomorphism theorem we have 
$$ 
M \cong R \big/ \ker f.
$$
Note that $\ker f = \text{Ann}_R(M)$, and we know that $\text{Ann}_R(M)$ is a left ideal, we have that $M \cong R\big/ I$. 

Next assume that $M \cong R\big/I$ for some ideal $I \subset R$.
We know that $R\big/I$ is generated by the element $[1]$ since for each $[r] \in R\big/I$, 
$$ 
r \cdot [1] = [r]
$$
Therefore, since we have an isomorphism $\varphi:R\big/I \to M$, then we have $M = \langle \varphi([1])\rangle$.
