# Statement
Let $R = \mathbb{C}[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ be a polynomial algebra [[202410031405|graded]] by degree and $S \subset R$ be a subalgebra for which there exists a surjective homomorphism 
$$
\varphi:R \longrightarrow S
$$
which preserves degree and is the identity on $S$. 
That is 
$$ 
\text{id}_S = \varphi \big|_S:S \to S.
$$
Then $S$ is a finitely generated algebra (and thus [[202409302318|Noetherian]]).
