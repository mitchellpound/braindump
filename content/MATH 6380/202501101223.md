# Definition
Let $M$ be an [[202409301254|R-module]]. 
$M$ is called **simple** or **irreducible** if it has no non-zero, proper submodules.

# Relation to cyclic modules
Every simple module is [[202501101219|cyclic]].

## Proof
Let $M$ be simple. 
Let $X\subset M$ generate $M$. 
Then, for each $x \in X$, we have $\langle x \rangle$ which is a submodule of $M$, therefore by assumption $\langle x \rangle = 0$ or $\langle x \rangle = M$. 
If $\langle x \rangle =0$ then it doesn't contribute anything, and we don't need it in the generating set, and we can consider $\langle X \backslash x \rangle = M$. 
If $\langle x \rangle = M$ then M is cyclic. 

## Converse is not true
Note, not every cyclic module is simple. 
Consider the $\mathbb{Z}$-module $\mathbb{Z}$. 
$\mathbb{Z} = \langle 1 \rangle$, but $2\mathbb{Z}$ is a submodule, so $\mathbb{Z}$ is cyclic but not simple. 
# Examples
$\mathbb{Z}$-modules can just be thought of as abelian groups, so the the simple modules are the groups of prime order. 

$\mathbb{C}$-modules are just $\mathbb{C}$ vector spaces, so the only simple modules are the 1 dimensional vector spaces, which are all isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$. 

The $\mathbb{C}[x]$ case is a lot more interesting. 

$\mathbb{C}[x]$ is a [[202409181251|PID]].
Therefore, from the [[202410091202|classification of finitely generated modules of PID modules]] for any $\mathbb{C}[x]$-module $M$ (let $R=\mathbb{C}[x]$)
$$
M \mathbb{c}ong R^{\oplus b} \oplus R \big/(p_1^{r_1}) \oplus \dots \oplus R \big/(p_n^{r_n})
$$
If $M$ is simple then it must be cyclic, so the only option are $M \mathbb{c}ong \mathbb{C}[x]$ or $M = \mathbb{C}[x]/(p)$ for some prime $p$. 
We know that $\mathbb{C}[x]$ as a module has proper submodules (since these the ideals of $\mathbb{C}[x]$) so we are left with $\mathbb{C}[x]/(p)$. 
In order for this to be simple $p$ must be an irreducible polynomial, and since $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed $p$ is of the form $(x - \lambda)$. 
Therefore, the simple $\mathbb{C}[x]$ modules are 
$$
\mathbb{C}[x] \big/ (x - \lambda) \cong \mathbb{C}.
