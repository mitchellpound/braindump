# Definition
Let $R$ be a [[202404171457|ring]] and $I \subset R$ be an [[202409172306|ideal]]. 
Let $R \big/ I$ be the quotient of the [[202407080915|abelian group]] $R$ by the (normal) subgroup $I$ (since $I$ is a subgroup under addition). 
This makes $R\big/ I$ an abelian group with elements 
$$ 
r + I \quad r \in R
$$
such that 
$$
r + I = s+I \ \text{in } R\big/I \Longleftrightarrow r-s \in I.
$$

Then we can take the product 
$$ 
(r + I)(s+I)  = rs +I
$$
which gives $R \big/I$ a ring structure. 
We call $R\big/I$ the **quotient of R by I**.
