# Definition
A **principal ideal domain (PID)** is an [[202409172236|integral domain]] such that every [[202409172306|ideal]] is principal (that is each $I = (r)$. 

# Examples
- [[202404171508|fields]]

- $\mathbb{Z}$ 

- $k[x]$ for $k$ a field.  

# Why do we care?
The theory of PID [[202409301254|modules]] is very interesting and accessible. 
For a whole long explanation of the theory look [[202410091202|here]].
