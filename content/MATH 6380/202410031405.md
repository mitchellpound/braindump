# Definition
A **graded ring** is a [[202404171457|ring]] $R$ with a decomposition as [[202407080915|abelian groups]] 
$$
R = \bigoplus_{i=0}^\infty R_i
$$
where multiplication satisfies $R_i \cdot R_j \subset R_{i+j}$.

In particular $R_0$ is a subring and $1 \in R_0$. 
# Homogeneous decomposition
Any $f \in R$ admits a unique **homogeneous decomposition** 
$$
f = \sum_{i = 0}^\infty f_i, \qquad f_i \in R_i,\quad f_i = 0 \text{ if } i\gg 0
$$
In this decomposition, $f_i$ is the **homogenous component of degree $i$**. 
We call $f$ **homogeneous** if $f=f_i$ for some $i$. 
Said another way, $f \in R_i \subset R$. 

## Homogeneous ideals
An ideal $I \subset R$ is **homogeneous** if it can be generated by homogeneous elements. 
# Examples 
- Polynomials - the polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ is graded by degree.
