# Theorem
1. The [[202411201032|minimal polynomial]] divides the [[202411201133|characteristic polynomial]]. 
2. The characteristic polynomial divides some power of the minimal polynomial
3. The characteristic and minimal polynomials have the same roots (not counting multiplicity)

## Proof
This is a corollary of [[202411201133#Relation to rational canonical form|this theorem.]] 
1. Follows directly from the theorem

2. Follows from the fact that $q_i | q_K$ for all $1\leq i\leq K$. Therefore, $\chi_T | q_K^K$. 

3. The follows from 1 and 2.
