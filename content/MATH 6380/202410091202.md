# Overview
The theory of [[202409301254|modules]] over a [[202409181251|PID]] is very interesting since it is simple enough to understand while giving a feel for deeper ring theory questions. 

PID's show up everywhere and many common examples of modules are over PID's so this is a good place to start anyways. 

Throughout these notes consider a [[202404171457|ring]] $R$ to be a PID.
# A notion of dimension
Let $M$ be a [[202409302304|free R-module]], and say that $M \cong R^{\oplus X}$ for some finite set $X$. 
The cardinality of $X$ is well-defined (that is if $M \cong R^{\oplus Y}$ then $|X| = |Y|$.) 
Thus, we write $\dim_R M$ for the cardinality of $X$. 

## Proof
#todo 

# Finitely generated submodules
Let $M$ be a ([[202410091049|finitely generated]]) free $R$-module. 
Then any submodule $N \subset M$ is free and $\dim_RN \leq \dim_RM$ 

## Proof
