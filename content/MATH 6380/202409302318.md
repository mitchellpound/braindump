# Definition
An [[202409301254|R-module]] is **Noetherian** if each of its submodules is finitely generated. 

# Relation to quotient
The condition above is generally hard to check, as we would need to check it for _each_ submodule. 
Instead we have the following proposition:

Let $M$ be an $R$-module with submodule $N$. 
Then $M$ is Noetherian if and only if $N$ and $M\big/ N$ are Noetherian. 

This means that every finite direct sum of Noetherian modules is Noetherian
# Relation to finitely generated
Let $R$ be a [[202409181256|Noetherian ring]]. 
An $R$-module is Noetherian if and only if it is finitely generated. 

## Proof
---
We need the following lemma:

**Lemma:** A [[202404171457|ring]] $R$ is Noetherian if and only if $R$ is Noetherian as an $R$-module.

**Proof of Lemma:** The submodules of $R$ are ideals of $R$ as a ring.

Let $M$ be Noetherian, then by definition $M \subseteq M$ the submodule being the whole module is finitely generated. 

Next, let $M$ be finitely generated. 
Thus, $M$ is a quotient of some [[202409302304#Relation to direct sums|free R-module]] $R^{\oplus n}$. 
$$
M = R^{\oplus n} \big/ S \quad\text{for some submodule } S \subset R^{\oplus n}
$$
Since $R$ is a Noetherian ring, then by the lemma then $R$ is a Noetherian $R$-module and thus, $R^{\oplus n}$ is also Noetherian. 
By the quotient property above we have that $M$ is Noetherian.
