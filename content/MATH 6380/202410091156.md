# Definition
For a [[202404171457|ring]] $R$ and a [[202409182227|module]] $M$, an element $m \in M$ is **torsion** if $rm = 0$ for some $r \neq 0$. 

If $R$ is commutative then the subset $M_{\text{tor}} \subset M$ consisting of torsion elements is called the **torsion** submodule. 
Note if $R$ is not commutative, then this set is not a submodule. 

# Examples
- For $k$ a field, then any $k$-module is just a vector space and the only torsion element is $0$. 

- The torsion elements of any $\mathbb{Z}$-module are elements of finite order.
