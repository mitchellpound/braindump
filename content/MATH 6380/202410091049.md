# Definition
Given a set $X \subset M$ for an [[202409301254|R-module]] $M$, the **submodule of $M$ generated by $X$** (denoted $\langle X \rangle$) is the smallest submodule that contains all points of $X$. 
More concretely, this is the submodule 
$$
\langle X \rangle \coloneqq \left\{ \sum_{x \in X} r_x x \ | \ r_x \in R \right\}
$$

We say $M$ is **finitely generated** if $M = \langle X \rangle$ for some finite set $X$. 

# Relation to free modules
A module $M$ is generated by $X \subset M$ if and only if there exists a surjective module homomorphism 
$$
F^R(X) \longrightarrow M
$$
where $F^R(X)$ denotes the [[202409302304|free R-module]] on $X$. 

In particular, $M$ is finitely generated if and only if there is a surjective module homomorphism 
$$
R^{\oplus n}\longrightarrow M \qquad n \geq 1.
$$

## Proof
If there exists the surjective module homomorphism $F^R(X) \to M$, then by the universal property of free R-modules, the free module is determined by the set map $X \to M$. 

Then, the image of $F^R(M) \to M$ is $\langle X \rangle$, so since the map is surjective $M = \langle X \rangle$. 

The other way is even easier. 
If $M$ is generated by $\langle X \rangle$ then the map $F^R(X)\to M$ will get to everything in $M$ by definition, so the map is surjective. 

## Remark
For finitely generated, we can take $R^{\oplus n}\to M$ to be determined by sending $1_R$ to the $n$ elements $m_1, \dots, m_n \in M$ that are the generators. 

This mean that every finitely generated $R$-module is a quotient of free $R$-modules. 

# Submodules of finitely generated modules
Submodules of finitely generated modules do not need to be finitely generated. 
(This is fixed by the definition of [[202409302318|Noetherian R-module]].)

For example, consider $\mathbb{Z}[x_1, x_2, \dots,]$. 
This is not a finitely generated ring, but as a free $\mathbb{Z}$ module it is finitely generated (by the element $1$). 
However, the submodule $(x_1, x_2, \dots) \subset \mathbb{Z}[x_1, x_2, \dots]$ is not finitely generated. 

To prove this, assume $(x_1, x_2, \dots)$ is finitely generated by generators $g_1, \dots, g_n$. 
Since these are finitely generated $g_1, \dots, g_n$ is only depends on finitely many variants $x_1, \dots, x_N$. 
Since $g_1, \dots, g_n$ are generators then 
$$
x_{N+1} = \sum_{j=1}^N r_jg_j
$$
However, if we set $x_1 = x_N = 0$ in this expression then we get $x_{N+1} = 0$ since $g_j$ has no constant term so they will all be 0. 
This is a contradiction since $x_{N+1}$ can't be 0.
