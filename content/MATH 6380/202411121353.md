# Definition
An [[202409301254|R-module]] $N$ is **flat** if the [[202409162145|functor]] from the [[20240103134157-tensor_product#Tensor products as functors|tensor product]]
$$
-\otimes_R N: R\text{-mod} \longrightarrow R\text{-mod}
$$
is exact. 
That is, for all [[202411121350|short exact sequences]] of $R$-modules
$$
0 \to M_1 \to M_2 \to M_3 \to 0
$$
the sequence 
$$
0 \to M_1 \otimes_R N \to M_2 \otimes_R N \to M_3 \otimes_R N\to 0
$$
is exact. 

In other words, since by [[202411121350#Behavior with tensoring in $R$-mod|this proposition]], the last three nodes are exact, flatness is a condition that for all injective $R$-module homomorphisms $M_1 \hookrightarrow M_2$, the morphism 
$$
M_1 \otimes_R N \longrightarrow M_2 \otimes_R N
$$
is injective.
