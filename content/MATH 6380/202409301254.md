# Definition
Let $R$ be a [[202404171457|ring]]. 
A (left) **$R$-module** is an [[202409301257|action]] of $R$ on an [[202407080915|abelian group]] $M$. 
More explicitly, this means that an $R$-module $M$, (equivalently a left action of a ring $R$ on $M$) is a homomorhphism of rings 
$$
\sigma:R \longrightarrow \text{End}_{\text{Ab}}(M)
$$

## Equivalent definition
Even more explicitly, any homomorphism of rings $\sigma$ as defined above will have the following properties. 
This can be taken as the definition as well.

Let 
$$
\rho:R \times M \longrightarrow M
$$
satisfying the requirements:
- $\rho(r, m+n)= \rho(r,m) + \rho(r,n)$

- $\rho(r + s,m) = \rho(r, m) + \rho(s,m)$ 

- $\rho(rs,m) = \rho(r, \rho(s,m))$ 

- $\rho(1,m) = m$ 
# Examples
- A $\mathbb{Z}$-module is just an abelian group

- If $R = k$ for some field, then the $R$-modules are vector spaces

- Any homomorphism of rings $\alpha:R \to S$ defines an $R$ action by taking 
$$ 
\rho(r,s) \coloneqq \alpha(r)s \qquad \forall r \in R, s \in S
$$

> [!NOTE] 
> This is an important example because it is how we build [[202409191335|R-algebras]]

#todo ADD GROUP REPRESENTATIONS - and group ring

# Morphisms
A **homomorphism** of $R$-modules $\varphi:M \to N$ is a homomorphism of abelian groups such that $\forall m, \tilde m \in M, r \in R$, 
- $\varphi(m + \tilde m) = \varphi(m) + \varphi(\tilde m)$

- $\varphi(rm) = r  \varphi(m)$ 
# Quotient modules
Given $N\subset M$ a submodule of $R$, we define the **quotient** module $M/N$ in the same way as abelian groups (with extra stuff):

As a set:
$$
M/N = \{m + N \ | \ m \in M\}
$$
that is, $[m] = [p] \Longleftrightarrow m-p \in N$. 

The $R$-action:
Since we know there exists a canonical projection map 
$$
\begin{split}
 \pi:M &\longrightarrow N \\
 m &\longmapsto [m]
\end{split}
$$
then we define 
$$
r \cdot (m + N) = rm + N
$$
therefore, $\pi$ is a $R$-module homomorphism.
