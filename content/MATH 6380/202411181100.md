# Overarching theorem
Let $M$ be a finite dimensional [[202411200925|vector space]] over $k$ and $X:M \to M$ a $k$-linear map. 
There is a decomposition 
$$
M \simeq M_1 \oplus + \dots + M_K
$$
where each $M_i$ is a cyclic $k[x]$-[[202409182227|module]] isomorphic to $k[x]/(q_i)$ for a polynomial $q_i \in k[x]$ such that 
$$
q_1 | \dots | q_K.
$$
Moreover, $q_1, \dots, q_K$ is uniquely determined by $M$ and $q_K$ is the [[202411201032|minimal polynomial]] of $M$. 

## Proof
Since $M$ is a vector space it is a finitely generated [[202410091156|torsion]] module by [[202411181059|this identification]]. 
Therefore, by the theorems for [[202410091202|finitely generated PID modules]], we can use the decomposition into cyclic modules. 

Since $q_i|q_K$ for all $i$, we have $q_K(X)=0$. 
There cannot be a polynomial of degree less than $q_K$ that would annihilate $M$ because it would not annihilate $M_K$. 
So $q_K$ is the minimal polynomial of $M$.  
# Rational canonical form
Using this decomposition, $M$ has a decomposition into a **rational canonical form** which is a basis of $M$ in which $X$ acts by the matrix 

$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
  \begin{array}{c|} C_{q_1} \\\hline \end{array} & &0\\
& \ddots& \\
0&& \begin{array}{|c} \hline C_{q_K}\end{array}
\end{array} 
\right]
$$

Where $C_{q_i}$ is the [[202411201032|companion matrix]] for the $i^{th}$ cyclic component. 
Moreover, two $k$-linear map $X,Y:M \to M$ are similar if and only if they have the same rational canonical form. 

## In a bigger field
Let $k \subset \mathbb K$ be a subfield and 
$$
X,Y \in \text{Mat}_{n \times n}(k) \subset \text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb K)
$$
1. The rational canonical form of $X$ is the same whether computed in $k$ or $\mathbb K$. 
In particular, the minimal polynomial of $X$ is the same whether computed in $k$ or $\mathbb K$ 

2. The matrices $X$ and $Y$ are similar over $k$ if and only if they are similar over $\mathbb K$. 
In particular, if there exists $P \in \text{GL}_n(\mathbb K)$ such that $X = PYP^{-1}$ then there exists $Q \in \text{GL}_n(k)$ such that $X = QYQ^{-1}$. 

### Proof
1. The rational canonical form of $X / k$ is defined over $\mathbb K$. Since rational canonical form is unique (and determines the minimal polynomial as the largest invariant factor), this prove the first statement. 

2. This statement is true by the first statement and that 2 matrices are similar if and only if they have the same rational canonical form. 

## Computing the rational canonical form
In order to compute the rational canonical form, we generally need to use the [[202411201133|characteristic polynomial]] and the [[202411210941|Cayley-Hamilton theorem]].
