# Definition
A **field extension** is a non-zero homomorphism of [[202404171508|fields]]
$$
k \longrightarrow K.
$$
The field $K$ is called an **extension of $k$**.


> [!NOTE] Non-zero field homomorphims
> We can think of $k \subset K$ since any non-zero ring homomorphism 
> $$
f:k \to R
> $$
> is injective since $\ker f \subset k$ is an ideal of $k$, but the only ideals of $k$ is $(0)$ or $k$ because it is a field. 


## Degree of extension
The **degree** of an extension $k \subset K$ is 
$$
[K:k] \coloneqq \dim_kK \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq1} \cup \{\infty\}
$$

### Examples
- For $\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$, $[\mathbb{R}:\mathbb{Q}] = \infty$ by cardinality of $\mathbb{Q}$ versus $\mathbb{R}$. 

- For $\mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}$, $[\mathbb{C}, \mathbb{R}] = 2$  since a basis for $\mathbb{C}$ over $\mathbb{R}$ is $\{1, i\}$. 

## Simple extensions
An extension $k \subset K$ is called **simple** if $K = k(\alpha)$ where $k(\alpha)$ is the smallest subfield of $K$ which contains $k$ and $\alpha$. 

# Field characteristic and extensions
Let $k\subset K$ be an extension. 
Then $k$ and $K$ have equal [[202501081312|characteristic]]. 

## Proof
Since an extension is a homomorphism of fields, then $1 \mapsto 1$, so the characteristic will be the same.
