# Definitions
## Weakly Hamiltonian action
A [[202405231344|symplectic action]] of $G$ on $(M,\omega)$ is called **weakly Hamiltonian** if every [[202405231250|fundamental vector field]] $X_{\xi}$ is a [[202405231223|Hamiltonian vector field]].

## Hamiltonian action
A symplectic action of $G$ on $(M, \omega)$ is called **Hamiltonian** if it is weakly Hamiltonian, and the diagram below commutes:

\usepackage{tikz-cd}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\tikzcdset{scale cd/.style={every label/.append style={scale=#1},
    cells={nodes={scale=#1}}}}
	
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzcd}[scale cd=2, sep=huge]
C^\infty(M) \arrow[d] & \mathfrak{g} \arrow[l, dashed, "\tilde{\mu}"] \arrow[d]\\
\mathfrak{X}_{\text{Ham}}(M) \arrow[r, hookrightarrow]& \mathfrak{X}_{\text{Symp}}(G)
\end{tikzcd}
\end{document}

```

i.e. an action is called Hamiltonian if there exists an equivariant [[202405231409|moment map]].
# Motivation
The [[202405231250|fundamental vector fields]] of a [[202405231344|symplectic action]] are symplectic. 
The goal is to identify an analogous definition for [[202405231223|Hamiltonian vector fields]] where the fundamental vector fields to the action are related to some function $H_{\xi}$ such that

$$
\iota_{\xi_{M}} = dH_{\xi} \qquad \forall \xi \in \mathfrak{g}.
$$

Note that this is already a stronger condition than a symplectic action since each Hamiltonian vector field must be symplectic.
However, this definition has issues.

Most importantly, the function $H_{\xi}$ isn't unique.
In fact, there can be infinitely many of them, since $H_{\xi}$ can differ by a constant.
Therefore, we aim to pick the function $H_{\xi}$ for each $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$ such that each of the fundamental vector fields were Hamiltonian?

So, we are looking for some map

$$
\begin{split}\tilde{\mu}:\mathfrak{g} &\longrightarrow C^{\infty}(M)\\
						   \xi & \longmapsto H_{\xi}
\end{split}
$$

such that

$$
\iota_{\xi_{M}}\omega = dH_{\xi}.
$$

We also want this map to be a [[202405062209|Lie algebra]] homomorphism so that it preserves the [[202405062213|Lie bracket]] $[-,-]$ on $\mathfrak{g}$ and the [[202405231236|Poisson bracket]] $\{-,-\}$ on $C^{\infty}(M)$ seen as a Lie bracket.
