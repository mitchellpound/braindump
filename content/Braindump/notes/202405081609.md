# Orbit under a group action
Let the [[202403121554|group]] $G$ [[202405081540|act]] on a set $X$. 
The **orbit** of $x\in X$ is 
$$ \mathcal{O}_x = \{gx \ | \ g\in G\}$$
It is all of the points we get when acting by the entire group. 

Notation: I've also seen the notation $G\cdot x$ as the orbit.
