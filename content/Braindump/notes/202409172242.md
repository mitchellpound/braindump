# Definition
A [[202404171457|ring]] $R$ is a **division ring** if every non-zero element $x \in R\backslash 0$ is a unit. 
That is, there exists $y,z \in R$ such that 
$$
xy = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad zx = 1 
$$

# Examples
The [[202409172252|quaternions]] $\mathbb{H}$ is a division ring that is not a [[202404171508|field]]. 

The polynomial ring $R[x]$ is never a division ring as $x \in R[x]$ is not a unit.
