# Definition
$M$ is a topological manifold of dimension $n$ if 
1. $M$ is a [[20240104115847-hausdorff_space|Hausdorff space]]. 
2. M is [[202403052131|second countable]]
3. M is locally Euclidean (with dimension $n$)
	This means that there is a [[20231222093631-chart|chart]] that maps an open neighborhood around every point to $\mathbb{R}^n$ homeomorphically. 
	(Locally the manifold "looks like $\mathbb{R}^n$".)
