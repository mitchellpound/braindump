# vanishing locus
Given a set $S \subset \mathbb{C}[x_1, \dots, x_n]$, the **vanishing locus** of the set $S$, is 
$$
V(S)\coloneqq \{z \in \mathbb{C}^n \ \big| \ f(z) = 0 \quad \forall f \in S\}
$$

Note, we don't need to do this where the base field is $\mathbb{C}$. 
We can find the vanishing locus for any family of polynomials $S$ in the polynomial ring $k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ for any [[202404171126|algebraically closed field]].
