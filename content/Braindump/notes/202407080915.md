# Definition
An abelian group is a [[202403121554|group]] $G$ that is commutative. 
That is, 

$$ab = ba \qquad \forall a, b \in G.$$

# Usefulness
Abelian groups are far easier to understand than most other groups. 
For example, finite abelian groups can be classified by isomorphism classes of [[202403151225|direct product (groups)]] of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ (for possibly different p's).
