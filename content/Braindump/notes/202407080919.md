# Definition
A **chain complex** is a [[202407080913|graded abelian group]] $A_\bullet$ with a differential 

$$d_\bullet = (d:A_n \longrightarrow A_{n-1})_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}$$

such that 
1. $d:A_n \to A_{n-1}$ is a [[202404301514|group homomorphism]]. 

2. $d^2 = 0$ (that is $A_{n+1} \xrightarrow{d} A_n \xrightarrow{d} A_{n-1}$ is 0 map)
