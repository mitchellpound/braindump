# Overview
The Hurewicz theorem gives a relationship between [[202407101116|homotopy group]] and [[202407082223| homology]] groups.

# $n=1$ case
For the case where $n=1$, we are looking at the [[202406180947|fundamental group]] and its relationship to the first [[202407082223|singular homology]] group $H_1(X)$.  

## Statement
$$H_1(X) \xrightarrow{\sim} \pi_1(X)_{ab}$$

## Proof
