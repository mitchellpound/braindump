# Overview
There is a connection between the [[202406180947|fundamental group]] of a [[202406282205|covering space]] and that of the base space. 

Moving the point around in the fiber "moves" the image subgroup of the [[202406180947#Pushforward of continuous maps|pushforward]] of the cover through conjugate subgroups. 

This means that for a cover $p:E \to X$ the image of $\pi_1(E)$ can be seen as a congugacy class of subgroups. 
Furthermore, it is an invariant of cover (doesn't change with any given point in the fiber.)


# Statement
Let $p:E \to X$ be a [[202406282205|cover]], with $x \in X$ and $e \in p^{-1}(x)$.
The homeomorphism 

$$p_*:\pi_1(E, e) \longrightarrow \pi_1(X, x)$$

is injective. 

Furthermore, if $e^\prime \in p^{-1}(x)$, then $p_*\pi_1(E, e^\prime)$ is conjugate to $p_*\pi_1(E, e)$. 

Conversely, if $H\subset \pi_1(X, x)$ is a subgroup that is conjugate to $p_*\pi_1(E, e)$, then there exists $e^\prime \in E$ such that 

$$H = p_*\pi_1(E, e^\prime).$$
