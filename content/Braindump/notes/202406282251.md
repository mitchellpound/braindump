# Overview
There is a relationship between the [[202406180947|fundamental group]] of a [[202406282205|covering space]] and the base. 

By using the pushforward along the defining map of the cover $p:(X, x_o)\to (E, e_0)$, we get a subgroup of the fundamental group of the base. 

The image subgroup $p_*\pi_1(X, x)$ consists of homotopy classes of loops in $X$ based at $x$ whose lifts to $E$ starting at $e$ are loops. 

# Statement
Given a [[202406282205|cover]] $p: E \to X$ with $e \in p^{-1}(x)$, the [[202406180947#Pushforward of continuous maps|pushforward]] 

$$p_*:\pi_1(E, e) \longrightarrow \pi_1(X, x)$$

is injective. 

Furthermore, if $e^\prime \in p^{-1}(x)$, then $p_*\pi_1(E, e^\prime)$ is conjugate to $p_*\pi_1(E, e)$. 
Conversely, if $H$ is a subgroup of $\pi_1(X, x)$ that is conjugate to $p_*\pi_1(E, e)$ then there exists $e^\prime$ such that $H = p_*\pi_1(E, e^\prime)$.
