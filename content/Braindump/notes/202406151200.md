# Definition
Consider $\mathbb{R}^{n + k}$ for $n, k \in \mathbb{N}$.
Let $[-, -]_{n, k}$ be a bilinear form defined as
$$ [x,y]_{n,k} = x_{1}y_{1} + \cdots + x_{n}y_{n} -x_{n+1}y_{n+1} - \cdots - x_{n+k}y_{n+k}.$$

The subgroup $\text{O}(n;k) \subset \text{GL}(n+k, \mathbb{R})$ that preserves this bilinear form (as opposed to the dot product that is preserved by the [[202406151159|orthogonal group]]) such that
$$[Ax, Ay]_{n,k} = [x,y]_{n,k}$$
is called the **generalized orthogonal group**.

The subgroup $\text{SO}(n;k) \subset \text{O}(n;k)$ with determinant 1 is called the **special generalized orthogonal group**.

Another way to identify the generalized orthogonal group is with the matrices $A \in \text{GL}(n+k,\mathbb{R})$ such that
$$ A^{T}gA = g$$
for the matrix
$$ g = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &&&&& \\
                         & \ddots &&&& \\
                         &&1&&&\\
                         &&&-1&&\\
                         &&&&\ddots&\\
                         &&&&&-1
                                \end{bmatrix}$$
Where the first $n$ entries along the diagonal are 1 and the remaining $k$ are $-1$.

# Lie group structure
We can show that $\text{O}(n;k)$ is a closed subgroup since if $A \in \text{O}(n;k)$ then it must satisfy the following equations:
$$
\begin{align*}
  [A_{-,j}, A_{-,l}]_{n,k} &= 0 \qquad j\neq l\\
  [A_{-,j}, A_{-,l}]_{n,k} &= 1 \qquad 1 \leq j \leq n\\
  [A_{-,j}, A_{-,l}]_{n,k} &= -1 \qquad n+1 \leq j \leq n + k
\end{align*}
$$

These equations are polynomials in the entries of $A$, so looking at the inverse image of the closed set defined above give the (closed) subgroup $\text{O}(n;k)$.

Clearly, $\text{SO}(n;k)$ will also be closed.
Therefore, by the [[202406170727|closed subgroup theorem]], both are [[202405061454|Lie groups]]. 

## Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(n;k)$
Let $\mathfrak{so}(n;k)$ be the [[202405062209|Lie algebra]] of $\text{O}(n;k)$ and $\text{SO}(n;k)$.

$$ \mathfrak{so}(n;k) = \{X \in \text{Mat}_{n + k \times n+k}(\mathbb{R}) \ | \ gX^{T}g = -X\}$$
