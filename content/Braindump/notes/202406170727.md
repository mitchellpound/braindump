# Closed subgroup theorem
The closed subgroup theorem is an important theorem in Lie theory because it gives us a way to "make" a lot of new and interesting [[202405061454|Lie groups]] from known existing ones. 

# Statement
For a [[202405061454|Lie group]] $G$, let $H \subset G$ be a (topologically) closed subgroup. 
Then $H$ is an embedded submanifold and therefore is a Lie subgroup. 

## Proof
