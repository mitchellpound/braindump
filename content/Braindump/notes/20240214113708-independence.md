# independence (probability)
Independence is where probability theory diverges from classical measure theory.
Independence is a strong condition that simplifies things a lot.

# Definitions
## For events
For a [[20240213222154-probability_space|probability space]] $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$, events $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ are *independent* if for every sub-collection

$$
P\left( \bigcap^k_{j=1} A_{i_j} \right) = \prod_{j=1}^k P(A_{i_j})
$$

## For collection of events
For a collection of events $\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2, \dots$ (i.e. $\mathcal{C}_i \subset \mathcal{F}$) the collections are *independent* if for every choice $C_i \in \mathcal{C}_i$ the events $C_1, C_2, \dots$ are independent.
