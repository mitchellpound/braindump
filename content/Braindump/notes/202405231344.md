# Definition
Let $G$ be a [[202405061454|Lie group]] that acts on a [[202404062124|symplectic manifold]] $(M, \omega)$ smoothly.
We call this action **symplectic** if for all $g \in G$ action map $\varphi_{g}:M \to M$ is a [[202405230016|symplectomorphism]], i.e.
$$ \varphi_{g}^{*}\omega = \omega.$$

# Relation to fundamental vector fields
For $G$ acting symplecticly on $M$, every [[202405231250|fundamental vector field]] $X_{\xi}$ for $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$ is a [[202405230022|symplectic vector field]].

## Proof
The [[202405081538|flow]] of the [[202404011135|vector field]] $X_{\xi}$ is $\exp(-t\xi)\cdot p$ by definition.
However, we know that $\exp(-t\xi) \in G$ for every $t \in \mathbb{R}$, and that the action is symplectic, so
$$\varphi_{\exp(-t\xi)}^{*}\omega = \omega$$
so the flow is a symplectomorphim for every $t \in \mathbb{R}$.

Therefore, we know that all the generating vector fields of a symplectic action are closed, i.e.
$$ d(\iota_{\xi_{M}} \omega) = 0 \qquad \forall \xi \in \mathfrak{g}.$$
