# free group
The **free [[202403121554|group]]** of a set $S$ is 
$$
{\prod_{s\in S}}^* \mathbb{Z}\cdot s
$$
Where ${\prod}^*$ denotes the [[202403151224|free product]] of the cyclic groups generated by all $s \in S$. 

# Notes
- Every group is a quotient of a free group. 
### Proof:
#todo 

- Not every group is a free group. For example $\mathbb{Z}_2 * \mathbb{Z}_2$ is a free product, but not a free group.
