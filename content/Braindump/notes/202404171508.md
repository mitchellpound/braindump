# Definition
A commutative [[202409172242|division ring]] is called a **field**.  

Since each non-zero element is a unit, we have a "division" operation by multiplying by the inverse of the element. 
In this case, since the ring is commutative, then the left and right inverses are the same. 

# Properties
A finite commutative [[202404171457|ring]] is a field if and only if it is an [[202409172236|integral domain]].  

**Proof:** #todo
