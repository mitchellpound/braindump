# field
A **field** $\mathbb{F}$ is a set with 4 operations. 
It can be defined as a commutative [[202404171457|ring]] with a multiplicative identity $1_\mathbb{F} \in \mathbb{F}$ where every non-zero element is a unit. 

Since each non-zero element is a unit, we have a "division" operation by multiplying by the inverse of the element.
