# Mean reversion
With [[202305211417|Stationary time series]] the mean is a constant for the entire time series, and the variance is constant, so the probabily of a series drifting from it's mean is limited. Thus, the series has a tendency to correct back to it's mean when it drifts too far away. 

How fast a series tends to revert back to the mean depends on the [[202305211518|Autocovariance]]. 
Non-stationary time series do not have mean-reversion.
