# Overview
Lie groups are [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifolds]] that are also [[202403121554|groups]] and those two structures are compatible. 
They were first studied to help solve differential equations. 
They are useful, since we can use calculus techniques combined with group properties to study symmetries. 

# Definition
A **Lie group** $G$ is a [[202403121554|group]] that is also a [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]] (or vice versa).
The structures are compatible in that the multiplication map 
$$m:G \times G \longrightarrow G$$ and the inversion map 
$$ i: G \longrightarrow G $$ are both [[202405021216|smooth maps]]. 

# Morphisms
A **Lie group homomorphism** $\phi:G \to H$ between Lie groups is a [[202404301514|group homomorphism]] that is also a [[202405021216|smooth map]]. 

# Lie subgroups
A **Lie subgroup** is a subset $H \subset G$ that is a subgroup ($H$ is closed under the group multiplication) such that the inclusion map $\iota: H \hookrightarrow G$ is a smooth immersion.
