# Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM)
Are models that use [[202306131117|Graph]]s to show a dependence structure of a joint probability distribution. By using the graph, advanced algorithms from graph theory can be used. 

PGM's are also more interpretable than other graph/ network structures like neural networks.
