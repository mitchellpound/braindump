# affine algebraic group
An **affine algebraic group** is an [[202404301434|affine algebraic variety]] $G$ together with a specified group structure (on the set of elements of $G$) such that group multiplication 
$$m: G \times G \longrightarrow G$$ and inversion 
$$ i:G \longrightarrow G$$
are [[202404301434#Morphism of affine algebraic varieties|morphisms of affine algebraic varieties]]. 

# Morphisms
For $G$ and $H$ affine algebraic groups, a map $\varphi:G \to H$ is a called a **morphism of affine algebraic groups** (or just a morphism) if 
1. $\varphi$ is a [[202404301434#Morphism of affine algebraic varieties|morphism of affine algebraic varieties.]]
2. $\varphi$ is a [[202404301514|group homomorphism]].
