# Bayes net criteria
The formal criteria for a [[202306162201|Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM)]] to be a [[202306162219|Bayesian network]] (mostly useful for proofs):

- The state space must be finite
- Each node is a variable 
	- If the node $X_i$ doesn't have a parent then it has a probability function (called a potential) $$p_{X_i}$$ Note this is a marginal distribution for the variable
	- If the node $X_i$ has parents $\Pi_i$, then it has a potential $$p_{X_i|\Pi_i}$$
- The factorization represented by the BN is minimal
	- The nodes are ordered so that a node's parents are a subset of the nodes before it in the ordering
	- for a node $X_j$, its set of parents $\Pi_j$ is the smallest set so that $X_i$ is conditionally independent of its non-parents. $$X_j \perp \Pi_j^c | \Pi_j$$
