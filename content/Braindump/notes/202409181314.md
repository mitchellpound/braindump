# Statement
Let $R$ be a [[202409181256|Noetherian ring]]. Then $R[x]$ is Noetherian. 

# Proof
Let $I \subset R[x]$ be an ideal, we aim to show that $I$ is finitely generated. 

Let $f_i \in I$ be of minimal degree. 
For $n\geq 1$, if $(f_1, \dots, f_n) \neq I$ then chose another polynomial $f_1 \in I \backslash (f_1, \dots f_n)$ of minimal degree (if there isn't another one then that means that $I = (f_1, \dots, f_n)$ is already finitely generated.)

We can take the leading coefficient $c_i \in R$  of each $f_i$. 
Thus, the ideal generated by all coefficients $(c_1, c_2, \dots)$ is finitely generated (since $R$ is Noetherian) by some list of generators we can call $(r_1, \dots, r_N)$. 

We aim to prove that $(f_1, \dots, f_N)= I$ for some $N$. 
For contradiction suppose that $I \neq (f_1,\dots, f_N)$. 
Then, like above we can pick some $f_{N+1}$ of minimal degree such that $f_{N + 1} \in I \backslash (f_1, \dots, f_N)$. 

We can write the leading coefficient $c_{N+1} \in (c_1, c_2, \dots)$ -- which has $N$ _finite_ generators -- as 
$$
c_{N+1} = \sum_{i = 1}^N c_i r_i \quad r_i \in R.
$$

We know that each of $f_i$ are of minimal degree at the time chosen so $\text{deg }f_{N+1} \geq \text{deg }f_j$ for $1 \leq j \leq N$, then we can build the polynomial 
$$
g \coloneqq \sum_{i = 1} r_i x^{\deg{f_{N+1}} - \deg{f_i}} f_i.
$$

The leading term of $g$ is built to be that of $f_{N+1}$ by how we build $c_{N+1}$.
Thus, we can take $f_{N+1}- g$ and the leading terms will cancel giving a polynomial of degree less than $f_{N+1}$. 
Importantly, $f_{N+1} - g \notin (f_1, \dots, f_n)$ since $f_{N+1} \notin (f_1, \dots, f_n)$. 
However, this is a contradiction since we assumed that $f_{N+1}$ is of minimal degree.

Therefore, $I$ is finitely generated and thus $R[x]$ is Noetherian.
