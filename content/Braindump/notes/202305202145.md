# Roots vs Branches - Israel
In Jacob 5:48, the banches overcame the roots so the tree became wild. 

Roots - those that have internalized the covanents. The foundation of the church. Those that honor covenants and bring others to Christ. They will NEVER leave the church. 

Branches - "New" members. Those that need help to get nourishment from the branches. 

The roots must strengthen before the tree can grow. Can't let the branches get ahead of themselves and "take sustenance unto themselves", they will inevitably change things that shouldn't be changed or break off.
