# domain (algebra)
An [[202404162325|algebra]] $A$ is called a **domain** if for element $a, b \in A$ such that $ab = 0$ then $a = 0$ or $b=0$. 

In other words, there are no zero divisors. 
This is a stronger condition than being reduced since if $A$ is a domain then it must be [[202404301425|reduced]].
