# Lie algebra
The concept of a Lie algebra is closely tied to a [[202405061454|Lie group]], but they are separate. 
Every Lie group has an associated Lie algebra, but the definition of a Lie algebra can be taken and used independently. 

# Definition
A **Lie algebra** is a vector space with a map called the [[202405062213|Lie bracket]]. 
The Lie bracket is a map $[\cdot, \cdot]:\mathfrak{g} \times \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g}$ that satisfies the following properties $\forall X,Y,Z \in \mathfrak{g}$ :
- Bilinearity: $[aX + bY, Z] = a[X,Z] + b[Y,Z]$ (and also in the second component.)
- Antisymmetry: $[X,Y] = -[Y, X]$ 
- Jacobi Indentity: $[X, [Y, Z]] + [Y, [Z,X]] + [Z,[X,Y]] = 0$

Note that a Lie algebra is NOT(!!) an [[202404162325|associative algebra]], the Jacobi identity is a type of substitute for associativity. 

# Morphisms 
A **Lie algebra homomorphism** is a linear map $\phi:\mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{h}$ that preserves the Lie bracket, i.e.
$$ \phi([X,Y]) = [\phi(X), \phi(Y)] \qquad \forall X,Y \in \mathfrak{g}$$

# Subalgebra
A **Lie subalgebra** is linear space $\mathfrak{h}\subseteq \mathfrak{g}$ that is closed under the Lie bracket.
