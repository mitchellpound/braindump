# Overview
The [[202407010952|lifting criterion]] gives conditions when a lift is gauranteed to exist, but will it be unique? 

# Statement
Given a [[202406282205|cover]] $p:E \to X$ and a map $f: Y \to X$ with two [[202407010952|lifts]] $f_1, f_2:Y \to E$ that agree at one point of $Y$, then if $Y$ is connected, these two lifts must agree on all of $Y$. 

## Proof
#todo
