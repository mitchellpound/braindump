# Defining map
If $S \subset M$ is an [[202405021637|embedded submanifold]], a smooth map $\varphi:M \to N$ is called a **defining map** if $S$ is a [[202405031332|regular]] [[202405281203|level set]], i.e. if 
$$S = \varphi^{-1}(\{n\})$$
for a regular point $n$. 

# Local defining map
A map is called **locally defining** if $\varphi:U \to N$ for some subset $U \subset M$ and $S \cap U$ is a regular level set. 

# Motivation
We call this a defining map, because based on the [[202405031346|regular value theorem]] this map along with the regular value $n \in N$ would define a submanifold. 

# Relation to tangent space of submanifold
For a submanifold $S \subset M$, if $\Phi:U \to N$ is a local defining map for $S$, then 
$$ T_pS = \ker d\Phi_p: T_pM \longrightarrow T_{\Phi(p)}N$$
for every $p \in S \cap U$.
