# Definition
A **deformation retract** is a [[202407110827|retract]] such that there is a [[20240112144635-homotopy|homotopy]] from the identity map to the retract. 

In other words, a deformation retract is a continuous map $r: X \to A$ from a [[20231220133911-topology|topological space]] $X$ to a subspace $A$ such that 

$$r\big|_A = id_A$$ 
and there exists a homotopy 

$$H:B\times I \longrightarrow B$$

such that 

$$H(a,t) = a \qquad \forall a \in A, t \in T, \quad \text{and} \quad H(x, 1) \in A \qquad \forall x \in X.$$
