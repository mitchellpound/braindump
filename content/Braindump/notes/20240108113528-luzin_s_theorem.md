# Luzin's Theorem

# Overview
Any [[20240108113617-borel_measurable_function|Borel measurable function]] is "almost" continuous.
If the function is not continuous, we can restrict the function to a closed set where the measure of everything not included is arbitrarily small.

There are two versions both say basically the same thing

# Theorem (Version 1)
For a Borel measurable function $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, $\forall \ \epsilon > 0$ there is a closed set $F \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ such that $|X\backslash F| < \epsilon$ and
$g|_{F}$ is a continuous function on $F$.

Note that this doesn't mean that $g$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ at all the points in $F$, it means that when considering only the domain as restricted to $F$ then $g$ is continuous.

## Proof
I didn't want to copy it again, so its on [[@axler2019]] page 66

# Theorem (Version 2)
For $E \subseteq R$ and a Borel measurable function $g:E \to \mathbb{R}$, for every $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a closed set $F \subseteq E$ and a continuous function $h:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $|E \backslash F| < \epsilon$ and $g|_{F} = h|_{F}$

I personally prefer this version. Note that h is called a continuous extension of g.

## Proof
I also don't want to write this one out. It's on page 68 of [[@axler2019]]
