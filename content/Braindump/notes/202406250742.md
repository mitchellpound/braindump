# Definition
A morphism in the category of [[202406241434|Poisson manifolds]] is a **Poisson map**, which is a map $\Phi:M_{1} \to M_{2}$ between Poisson manifolds that respects the [[202405231236|Poisson brackets]].

That is

$$ \{f \circ \Phi, f \circ \Phi\}_{1} = \{f, g\}_{2} \circ \Phi \qquad \forall f, g \in C^{\infty}(M_{2}).$$
