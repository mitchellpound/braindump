# associative algebra
## Definition
An associative algebra (over a field) is a vector space $A$ with a "multiplication" operation 
$$
\bullet:A \times A \longrightarrow A
$$
(where we generally suppress the $\cdot$ notation and put them next to each other) such that 
1. Associativity (what makes the difference from a non-associative algebra)
$$a(bc) = (ab)c$$
2. Distributive
$$ a(b + c) = ab + ac$$
3. 
$$ (a + b)c = ac + bc$$
4. $$
(\lambda a)(\mu b) = (\lambda \mu)(ab) \qquad \forall \lambda,\mu \in \mathbb{F}, a,b \in A $$
We call $A$ **commutative** if $ab = ba$ for all $a,b \in A$. 

If you want to rule out the trivial algebra, you can include the requirement that there exists and element $1 \in A$ such that $1 \neq 0$ and 
$$ 
1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a \qquad \forall a \in A
$$

Note: There is an equivalent definition using a [[202404171457|ring]] that has an extra operation. 
# subalgebras
A subset $B \subset A$ is a **subalgebra** if 
1. $B$ is a vector subspace of $A$
2. $bc \in B$ for all $b,c \in B$
3. $1 \in B$

Using this definition, we can prove that for a subalgebra $B\subset A$, the algebra structure of $B$ is the unique one for which the inclusion map $B \to A$ is an [[202404162335|algebra homomorphism]]. 

In other words, $B$ inherits its algebra structure from $A$. 

# Generating subalgebras
For a subset $S \subset A$, the subalgebra of $A$ generated by $S$ is 
$$
\left( S \right) \coloneqq \bigcap_{\begin{split}B \subset A \ &\text{subalgebra} \\ \text{s.t.}  &\ S \subset B \end{split}} B
$$
We can think of it as the smallest subalgebra that contains all of $S$. 
If $S$ is not an ideal, it will have other stuff in it, but this is the "best" subalgebra with as little other stuff as possible. 

## Explicit construction
$\left( S \right)$ is the set of all finite $\mathbb{F}$-linear combos of finite products of elements of $S$. 
$$
(S) = \left\{ \sum_{j=1}^n \lambda_j a_{j_1}a_{j_2}\dots a_{j_{k_j}} \ \bigg| \ n,k_j \in \mathbb{Z}^+, \lambda_j \in \mathbb{F}, a_{j_l} \in S\right\}
$$
