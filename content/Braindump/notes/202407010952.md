# Overview
From [[202406282227|path lifting lemma]] we know that we can uniquely lift paths and [[20240112144635-homotopy|homotopies]], but an interesting question is when can any general map be lifted to a [[202406282205|covering space]]? 
And if it can be lifted, is that lift [[202407011003|unique]]?

This is a criterion conditions that guarantee the map can be lifted.
# Statement
Let $p:(E, e) \to (X, x)$ be a [[202406282205|cover]] and $f:(Y, y) \to (X, x)$ be a map with $Y$ path connected and locally path connected.

Then a lift $\tilde{f}:(Y, y) \to (E, e)$ exists if and only if $f_*\pi_1(Y, y) \subset p_*\pi_1(X, x)$. 

Here's a diagram to visualize the lift:
```tikz
\usepackage{tikz-cd}

\tikzcdset{scale cd/.style={every label/.append style={scale=#1},
    cells={nodes={scale=#1}}}}
	
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzcd}[scale cd=2, sep=huge]
& E \arrow[d, "p"]\\
Y \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[ur, "\tilde{f}"]& X

\end{tikzcd}

\end{document}
```
