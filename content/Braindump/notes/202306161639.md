# Stationary MC distribution
If you can find a distribution in a [[202306161624|Markov chain]] where 
$$p_t = p \Rightarrow p_{t+t} = p$$
then each of the following state distributions will be $p$. 
Thus, once a Markov chain gets into state distribution $p$, then it is a [[202305211417|Stationary time series]]. 

Formally the distribution must satisfy 
$$p = Kp$$
or
$$p(y) = \int_x K(x,y) p(x) \ dx $$
So $p$ must be a (unit) eigenvector or eigen function with an eigenvalue of 1.
