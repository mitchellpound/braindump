# Definition
The **fundamental group** of a [[20231220133911-topology|topological space]] $X$ based at $x \in X$ is 

$$\pi_1(X, x) = P(x,x) / \sim = \{\text{loops at $x$}\}/\text{homotopy}$$


It is the [[20240112144635-homotopy|homotopy]] equivalence classes of loops.
We consider the group multiplication to be composition of loops
i.e. 

$$ [\gamma] \cdot [\delta] = [\gamma \circ \delta]$$
# Proof this is a group
The fundamental group follows the [[202403121554|group]] axioms as shown below:

## Group operation
Composition of paths is defined as
$$(\delta \cdot \gamma)(s) = \begin{cases} \gamma(2s) & 0 \leq s \leq \frac{1}{2} \\ \delta(2s-1) & \frac{1}{2} \leq s \leq 1\end{cases}$$

## Inversion
Inversion is defined as 
$$
\begin{split}
P(x,y) &\longrightarrow P(x,y)\\
\gamma(s) &\longmapsto \gamma^{-1}(s)
\end{split}
$$

where $\gamma^{-1}(s) = \gamma(1-s)$.

## Identity element
There exists a constant path $C_x \in P(x,x)$ such that $C_x(t) = x$ for all $t \in I$. 

## Well defined for equivalence classes
- Composition of paths descends to homotopy classes 

$$ [\delta] \cdot [\gamma] = [\delta \cdot \gamma]$$
- Constant paths are half identity up to homotopy
For a path $\gamma$ from $x \to y$ 

$$[\gamma] \cdot [C_x] = [\gamma]$$

and 

$$[C_y] \cdot [\gamma] = [\gamma]$$
- Inversion is defined in homotopy classes
$$[\gamma^{-1}]\cdot [\gamma] = [C_x]$$

# Pushforward of continuous maps
Let $f:X \to Y$ be a continuous map. 
Then the pushforward

$$
\begin{split}
f_*: \pi_1(X, x) &\longrightarrow \pi_1(Y,f(x)) \\
[\gamma] & \longrightarrow [f \circ \gamma]
\end{split}
$$

is a group homomorphism. 

Thus, the fundamental group depends (up to isomorphism) only on $X$ and the path components of $X$. 

# Homotopy equivalence
Let $X$, $Y$ be (path connected) topological spaces that are [[202406180932|homotopy equivalent]]. 
Then $\pi_1(X) \simeq \pi_1(Y)$. 

# Examples
$$\pi_1(\mathbb{R}^n) \simeq 0$$
$$\pi_1(S^1) \simeq \mathbb{Z}$$
Can be proved with [[202406240803|Lebesgue number lemma]].
