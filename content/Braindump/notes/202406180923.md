# Definition
Let $X$ be a [[20231220133911-topology|topological space]], and $x, y \in X$. A **path** from $x$ to $y$ is a continuous function 

$$ \gamma: I \longrightarrow X$$

such that $\gamma(0) = x$ and $\gamma(1) = y$ . 

(basically the same thing as a [[202405081514|curve]], just for simplicity we have it always on the interval $[0,1]$.)
