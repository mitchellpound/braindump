# Kolmogorov's 0-1 law

For a [[20240213222154-probability_space|probability space]] $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ and a squence of sigma algebras $\mathcal{F}_1, \mathcal{F}_2, \dots \subset \mathcal{F}$ are [[20240214113708-independence|independent]] and $A \in \mathcal{T}$ where $\mathcal{T}$ is the [[20240215003029-tail_field|tail field]] then $P(A) = 0 \ \text{or } 1$.

# Proof
The idea behind the proof is that we can show that $A$ is independent from itself.
We do this by breaking up the series of $\sigma$ -algebras at an index $n$.

Let the event $A \in \mathcal{T}$.
Then we know that for the sigma algebra
$$ \mathcal{H} = \sigma\left(\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty \mathcal{F}_j \right) $$
$A \in \mathcal{H}$ because $A$ is in the tail field.

We want to show that $A$ is independent from every event in $\mathcal{H}$.

Note that if we have three collections of events that are independent from each other, then combining two of them into one set will give us 2 independent collections of events.
(This is a lemma that should be proved, but not for my notes :) ).

Using this idea, we can combine the first $k$ $\sigma$ -algebras and the next $k-r$ for $r>k$ into two independent ones.
In other words,

$$\sigma\left( \bigcup_{n=1}^k \mathcal{F}_n \right) \perp \sigma\left(\bigcup_{n=k+1}^r \mathcal{F}_n \right)$$

Now let $r\to \infty$ then we have

$$\sigma\left( \bigcup_{n=1}^k \mathcal{F}_n \right) \perp \sigma\left(\bigcup_{n=k+1}^\infty \mathcal{F}_n \right)$$

Note here that $k$ is arbitrary, and $A$ is an element of the second $\sigma$ -algebra, then as $k$ gets very large we see that $A \perp A$.
This means that $P(A) = P(A)P(A)$ so $P(A)$ must be 0 or 1.
