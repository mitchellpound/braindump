# $\mathfrak{X}(M)$ - the space of all vector fields
We can take the space $\mathfrak{X}(M)$ of vector fields on a smooth manifold $M$. 
This is a vector space, since elements can be added and scaled pointwise
$$(X+Y)_p = X_p + Y_p \qquad \forall X,Y \in \mathfrak{X}(M).$$
In this way, it uses the vector space structures of the fibers. 

# As a Lie algebra

For a vector field $X \in \mathfrak{X}(G)$ and a smooth function $f \in \Omega^{0}(G)$, we can combine these in several ways.
We can multiply the function and the vector field
$$(fX)_{p} = f(p)X_{p}.$$
We can also evaluate $X$ on $f$ ($X$ is an operator on the smooth functions $G \to \mathbb{R}$.)
If $f:U \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined on an open set $U\subset G$,
 $$ 
  \begin{split}
    Xf:U &\longrightarrow \mathbb{R} \\
    p &\longmapsto X_{p}(f).
    \end{split}
$$

Thus, for a function $f:G \to \mathbb{R}$, we can view $Xf:G \to\mathbb{R}$ as its own smooth function, and we can apply another vector field to it,
$$ YXf = Y(Xf).$$

The only problem is that this new object $YX$ is not guaranteed to be a derivation, so while it is an operator on smooth functions (i.e. $YX \in \mathcal{O}^{*}_{G,p}$) it may not be in the tangent space.

So, instead we can use the special commutator bracket $[\cdot, \cdot]:\mathfrak{X}(G) \to \mathfrak{X}(G)$ where
$$[X, Y](f) = X(Yf) - Y(Xf) \qquad\forall X,Y \in \mathfrak{X}(G).$$

### Proposition
  For $X,Y \in \mathfrak{X}(G)$, $[X,Y]$ is a derivation, and thus $[X,Y] \in \mathfrak{X}(G)$.
#### Proof
Proof in here... #todo 

### It really is a Lie algebra
$\mathfrak{X}(G)$ is a Lie algebra with Lie bracket $[\cdot,\cdot]$ as defined above.
#### Proof
#todo 
**Bilinearity:**

**Antisymmetry:**

**Jacobi Identity:**
