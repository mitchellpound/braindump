# algebra homomorphism
For [[202404162325|algebras]] $A$ and $B$, a map $\varphi:A \to B$ is an **algebra homomorphism** if it satisfies the following conditions:
1. $\varphi$ is linear
2. $\varphi$ respects multiplication in the algebra
$$ 
\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)
$$
3. $\varphi(1) = 1_B$ 

If there exists an inverse morphism then $\varphi$ is called an isomorphism. 
Note, for this category, it suffices to check that $\varphi$ is a bijective homomorphism to prove it is an isomorphism.
