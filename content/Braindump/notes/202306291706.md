# connections is change
In the same way that repentance is about _change_ and _connecting_ us with God. Learning is about _change_ within our understanding, and _connecting_ previously extracted truths to those we are currently wrestling with. In this way, repentance is learning truths and connecting them with truths about ourselves and God.
