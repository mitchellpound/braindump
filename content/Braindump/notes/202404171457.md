# Definition
A **ring** is a set $R$ that has two operations $+$ and $\cdot$.
They must satisfy the _ring_ axioms:
1. $R$ is an abelian [[202403121554|group]] under addition
2. Multiplication is associative
$$ 
(a\cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c) \qquad \forall a,b,c \in R
$$
3. Multiplication is closed: $a\cdot b \in R$ for all $a,b \in R$. 
4. Multiplication is distributive:
- left distributive $a \cdot (b + c) = a\cdot b + a \cdot c$
- right distributive $(a + b) \cdot c = a\cdot c + b \cdot c$ 

# Morphisms
Morphisms in the category $\text{Ring}$ are called ring homomorphisms. 
A **ring homomorphism** is a map $f:R \to S$ which satisfies 
1. $f(r_1 + r_2) = f(r_1) + f(r_2)$
2. $f(r_1r_2) = f(r_1)f(r_2)$
3. $f(1_R) =1_S$

# Types of rings
Some important classes of rings are
- [[202409172236|domain (ring theory)]]
- [[202409172242|division ring]]
- [[202404171508|field]]

Note 
$$
\text{field} \implies \text{division ring} \implies \text{domain}.
$$
