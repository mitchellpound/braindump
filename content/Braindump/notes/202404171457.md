# ring
A **ring** is a set $R$ that has two operations $+$ and $\cdot$.
They must satisfy the _ring_ axioms:
1. $R$ is an abelian [[202403121554|group]] under addition
2. Multiplication is associative
$$ 
(a\cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c) \qquad \forall a,b,c \in R
$$
3. Multiplication is closed: $a\cdot b \in R$ for all $a,b \in R$. 
4. Multiplication is distributive:
- left distributive $a \cdot (b + c) = a\cdot b + a \cdot c$
- right distributive $(a + b) \cdot c = a\cdot c + b \cdot c$
