# topology
# Background
A generalization of open sets, also called topological space (a set X combined with a topology)

# Definition
For a set X, a topology on $\tau$ on X is a set of subsets $U\subset X$ (called open sets) such that
1. $\emptyset$, $X \in \tau$
2. Closed under arbitrary union:
    for an index set I (not necessarily countable or finite - can be arbitrary) for $U_{i \in I} \in \tau$
    $$\bigcup_{i\in I}U_i \in \tau$$
3. Closed under finite intersection:
    for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $U_i \in \tau$ for $i = 1,...,n$
    $$\bigcap_{i=1}^n U_i \in \tau $$
