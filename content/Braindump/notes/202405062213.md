# Lie bracket
The "multiplication" of vectors in a [[202405062209|Lie algebra]]. 
It must satisfy the following properties. 
- Bilinearity: $[aX + bY, Z] = a[X,Z] + b[Y,Z]$ (and also in the second component.)
- Antisymmetry: $[X,Y] = -[Y, X]$ 
- Jacobi Indentity: $[X, [Y, Z]] + [Y, [Z,X]] + [Z,[X,Y]] = 0$
