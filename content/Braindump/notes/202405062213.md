# Lie bracket
The "multiplication" of vectors in a [[202405062209|Lie algebra]]. 
It must satisfy the following properties. 
- Bilinearity: $[aX + bY, Z] = a[X,Z] + b[Y,Z]$ (and also in the second component.)
- Antisymmetry: $[X,Y] = -[Y, X]$ 
- Jacobi Indentity: $[X, [Y, Z]] + [Y, [Z,X]] + [Z,[X,Y]] = 0$

# Examples of Lie bracket of $\text{Lie}(G)$
For the [[202405081415|Lie algebra of a Lie group]], the Lie bracket can be defined in many equivalent ways.
## Using vector fields
Let $G$ be a Lie group, and let $\mathfrak{X}_L(G)$ denote the $\mathbb{R}$ vector space of [[202405081440|left-invariant vector field]] on $G$.

$$
\begin{split} \varphi: \mathfrak{X}_{L}(G) &\longrightarrow T_{e}G = \mathfrak{g}\\
X &\longmapsto X_{e}
\end{split}
$$
is a vector space isomorphism.

The Lie bracket on vector fields is given by the commutator bracket 

$$
[X, Y](f) = XY(f) - YX(f)
$$

Thus, we can find the Lie bracket of $x,y \in \mathfrak{g}$ using $\varphi$ such that 

$$
[x,y] = \varphi\bigg([\varphi^{-1}(x), \varphi^{-1}(y)]\bigg)
$$

## Using representations
The [[202407172026|adjoint representation of the Lie algebra]] gives an equivalent definition of the Lie bracket. 

$$
[x,y] = \text{ad}_{x}(y) \qquad \forall x,y \in \mathfrak{g}
$$


## Using the Lie derivative
The [[202405222331|Lie derivative]] gives yet another way to (equivalently) define the Lie bracket.

$$
[X, Y] = \mathcal{L}_XY.
