# Definition
Two [[202404011135|vector fields]] $X, Y \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$ are said to **commute** if the [[202405062213|Lie bracket]] is zero, i.e.
$$ [X,Y] = 0$$
This is because 
$$[X,Y] = XY(f) - YX(f) = 0 \implies XY(f) = YX(f) \quad \forall f \in C^\infty(M)$$

# Relation to flows
Smooth vector fields commute if and only if their [[202405081538|flows]] commute.
