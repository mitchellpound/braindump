# differential
The differential is a way to map between [[202403251438|tangent spaces]]. 
It works for manifolds, algebraic varieties, etc... but the definition I'll write down is for manifolds (though nothing changes really.)

It is a coordinate-free analogue to the Jacobian. 
# Definition
For a map between [[202403052130|manifolds]] $F:M \to N$ and a point $p \in M$, define 
$$
\begin{align}
dF_p: T_pM &\to T_{F(p)}N\\
v &\mapsto \left(\begin{aligned}dF_p(v):\mathcal{O}_{N,F(p)} &\to \mathbb{R}\\ f &\mapsto v(F^*f)\end{aligned}\right)
\end{align}
$$
Written somewhat nicer, 
$$
dF_p(v)(f) = v(f\circ F).
$$

Note this is linear, and because $v$ is a derivation, $dF_p(v)$ is a derivation (this is glossing over some of the calculation though). 

# Chain rule
Given manifolds (or [[202404301434|affine algebraic varieties]]) $X,Y,Z$ with maps 
$$\varphi:X \to Y \qquad \psi:Y \to X$$
for a point $x \in X$, we know we can find the differentials
$$d\varphi_x: T_xX \to T_{\phi(x)}Y \qquad d\psi_{\phi(x)}:T_{\phi(x)}Y \to T_{\psi(\phi(x))}Z$$
Then 
$$ d(\psi\circ\varphi)_x = d \psi_{\varphi(x)} \circ d\varphi_x$$
# Rank
We can define the **rank of a [[202405021216|smooth map]] at a point $x \in M$** (can be generalized I guess, but I don't need that now...) as 
$$ \text{rank}_x(F) = \text{rank}(df_x)$$
