# differential
The differential is a way to map between [[202403251438|tangent spaces]]. 
It works for manifolds, algebraic varieties, etc... but the definition I'll write down is for manifolds (though nothing changes really.)

It is a coordinate-free analogue to the Jacobian. 
# Definition
For a map between manifolds $F:M \to N$ and a point $p \in M$, define 
$$
\begin{align}
dF_p: T_pM &\to T_{F(p)}N\\
v &\mapsto \left(\begin{aligned}dF_p(v):\mathcal{O}_{N,F(p)} &\to \mathbb{R}\\ f &\mapsto v(F^*f)\end{aligned}\right)
\end{align}
$$
Written somewhat nicer, 
$$
dF_p(v)(f) = v(f\circ F).
$$

Note this is linear, and because $v$ is a derivation, $dF_p(v)$ is a derivation (this is glossing over some of the calculation though).
