# Definition
An **exact sequence** is a sequence of morphisms between objects (usually [[202403121554|groups]]) such that the image of one morphims equals the kernel of the next. 

So for 
$$U \xrightarrow{\varphi} V \xrightarrow{\psi}W$$
then we have 
$$\text{im}\varphi = \ker \psi$$

# Short exact sequences
Lots of cool group theory here... #todo
