# Embedded submanifold
Let $M$ be a [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]] with dimension $n$. 
A subset $S \subset M$ is a **submanifold** (of dimension $k$) of $M$ if for every point $x \in S$ there exists a chart $\phi:U \subset S \subset M \to W \subset\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $x \in U$ and 
$$\phi(U\cap S) = \{(x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \phi(U)\ | \ x^{k+1} = \dots = x^n = 0\} = W\cap(\{0\} \times \mathbb{R}^k)$$

This will definitely have a smooth manifold structure since we can take $U \cap S$ to be the charts on $S$ which are already smooth charts. 
We can "forget" about the extra dimensions since in $S$ they are all 0 anyway. 

**Alternative definition:** (from [[@lee2013]]) We could also say that a submanifold is a subset $S \subset M$ that is a manifold such that the inclusion map $S \hookrightarrow M$ is a [[202405021612|smooth embedding]]. 

# Tangent space of submanifolds
**Main point:** If $S \subset M$ is a submanifold, then for $p \in S$, $T_pS \subset T_pM$ is a linear subspace. 

Since $\iota:S \to M$ is a smooth immersion by definition, then $d\iota_p(v)$ is injective for $v \in T_pS$. 
We can see this directly using the definition of the [[202403092121|differential]]:
For $\tilde{v} = d\iota_p(v) \in T_pM$

$$ \tilde{v} = d\iota_p(v) = v(f \circ \iota) = v(f|_S)$$

So in order to evaluate a tangent vector at a point, we just restrict the function to the submanifold. 

## Characterization of the submanifold tangent space
For a submanifold $S \subset M$, $T_pS \subset T_pM$ can be characterized as the subspace such that 
$$ T_pS = \{ v \in T_pM \ | \ v(f)= 0 \ \text{for } f \in C^\infty(M) \ \text{such that } f|_S = 0\}$$

We can also use a [[202405281152#Relation to tangent space of submanifold|defining map]] to identify the tangent space of the submanifold.
