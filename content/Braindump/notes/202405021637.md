# Embedded submanifold
Let $M$ be a [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]] with dimension $n$. 
A subset $S \subset M$ is a **submanifold** (of dimension $k$) of $M$ if for every point $x \in S$ there exists a chart $\phi:U \subset S \subset M \to W \subset\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $x \in U$ and 
$$\phi(U\cap S) = \{(x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \phi(U)\ | \ x^{k+1} = \dots = x^n = 0\} = W\cap(\{0\} \times \mathbb{R}^k)$$

This will definitely have a smooth manifold structure since we can take $U \cap S$ to be the charts on $S$ which are already smooth charts. 
We can "forget" about the extra dimensions since in $S$ they are all 0 anyway. 

**Alternative definition:** (from [[@lee2013]]) We could also say that a submanifold is a subset $S \subset M$ that is a manifold such that the inclusion map $S \hookrightarrow M$ is a [[202405021612|smooth embedding]].
