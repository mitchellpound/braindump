# Definition
A **Poisson algebra** is an [[202404162325|associative algebra]] $A$ with a [[202405231236|Poisson bracket]]. 

# Example
Probably the most important example will be the associative algebra of [[202405021546|smooth functions]] $\mathcal{O}_M$ for a [[202404062124|symplectic manifold]] $(M, \omega)$. 
The Poisson bracket is defined on smooth functions $f, g:M \to \mathbb{R}$  as
$$ \{f,g\} = \omega(X_f, X_g)$$ where $X_f, X_g$ are the [[202405231223|Hamiltonian vector fields]] of the functions $f$ and $g$. 

## Poisson commuting functions
If $\{f,g\}=0$ for smooth functions $f, g \in C^{\infty}(M)$, then
- $f$ is constant on integral curves of $X_{g}$
- $g$ is constant on integral curves of $X_{f}$.
