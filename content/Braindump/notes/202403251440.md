# dual space
For a $\mathbb{F}$-vector space $V$ (note not necessarily finite dimensional) the corresponding dual space $V^*$ is the vector space of linear forms. 
Or written another way, $\varepsilon \in V^*$, $\varepsilon: V \to \mathbb{F}$ is a linear map. 

Addition and scalar multiplication are defined pointwise.
