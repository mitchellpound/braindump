# Defintion
A [[202405231344|symplectic action]] of $G$ on $(M,\omega)$ is called **weakly Hamiltonian** if every [[202405231250|fundamental vector field]] $X_{\xi}$ is a [[202405231223|Hamiltonian vector field]].

# Obstructions to being (fully) Hamiltonian
If an action is weakly Hamiltonian, there is no restriction on the "way" you find functions that are the Hamiltonian functions are assigned to [[202405231250|fundamental vector fields]].
As opposed to [[202405231352|Hamiltonian actions]], there is no requirement for the [[moment map]] (used the term loosely) to be equivariant, or equivalently that the co-moment map is a Lie algebra homomorphism (also see [[202409031613|equivariance of moment map]]).

## Proposition:
Let there be a weakly Hamiltonian $G$-action on $(M, \omega)$, and choose a linear map
$\mathfrak{g} \to C^{\infty}$ such that $\xi \mapsto H_{\xi}$ and $\xi_{M} = X_{H_{\xi}}$ where $X_{f}$ denotes the Hamiltonian vector field of $f$.
Then there is a (unique) map $\tau:\mathfrak{g} \times \mathfrak{g} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $\xi, \eta \in \mathfrak{g}$,

$$
\{H_{\xi}, H_{\eta}\} - H_{[\xi, \eta]} = \tau(\xi, \eta).
$$

This function satisfies
$$ \tag{1}
\tau([\xi, \eta], \zeta) + \tau([\eta, \zeta], \xi) + \tau([\zeta, \xi], \eta) = 0.
$$

### Proof
First note that

$$
X_{H_{[\xi, \eta]}} = [\xi, \eta]_{M} = [\xi_{M}, \eta_{M}] = [X_{H_{\xi}}, X_{H_{\eta}}]
$$

since $\xi \to \xi_{M}$ is a Lie algebra homomorphism.
Note that both $X_{H_{\xi}}$ and $X_{H_{\eta}}$ are Hamiltonian (and thus symplectic) vector fields, so $[X_{H_{\xi}}, X_{H_{\eta}}]$ is a Hamiltonian vector field with Hamiltonian function $\omega(X_{H_{\xi}}, X_{H_{\eta}})$
thus,
$$X_{H_{[\xi, \eta]}} =  [X_{H_{\xi}}, X_{H_{\eta}}] = X_{\omega(X_{H_{\xi}}, X_{H_{\eta}})} = X_{\{H_{\xi}, H_{\eta}\}}.$$

This implies that the function $H_{[\xi, \eta]} - \{H_{\xi}, H_{\eta}\}$ is always constant.
Therefore,
$$\{H_{[\xi, \eta]} - \{H_{\xi}, H_{\eta}\}, H_{\zeta}\} = 0 \implies \{H_{[\xi, \eta]}, H_{\zeta} \} = \{H_{\xi}, H_{\eta}\}, H_{\zeta}\}$$

Hence, since $\tau$ is linear, and $\{H_{\xi}, H_{\eta}\}, H_{\zeta}\}$ (and thus $\{H_{[\xi, \eta]}, H_{\zeta} \}$) follows the Jacobi identity, then it $\tau$ also follows it as seen in equation $(1)$.

## Relation to Lie algebra cohomolgy
Now consider a 2-cocycle of the [[202409061158|Lie algebra cohomology]] , i.e. a cochain $f$ such that $df = 0$.

As the explicit formula for the differential operator is 
$$
\begin{split}
(df)(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n+1}) &= \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} (-1)^{i+1} x_i \cdot f(x_1, \ldots, \hat{x_i}, \ldots, x_{n+1}) \\
 &\qquad + \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n+1} (-1)^{i+j} f([x_i, x_j], x_1, \ldots, \hat{x_i}, \ldots, \hat{x_j}, \ldots, x_{n+1})
\end{split}
$$

then by looking specifically at a 2-cocycle $\alpha$ we have
$$d\alpha(\xi, \nu, \zeta) = \xi \cdot \alpha(\eta, \zeta) - \eta \cdot \alpha(\xi, \zeta) + \zeta \cdot \alpha(\xi, \eta) - \alpha([\xi, \eta], \zeta) + \alpha([\xi, \zeta], \eta) - \alpha([\eta, \zeta], \xi) = 0.$$
Since $\mathbb{R}$ is a trivial $\mathfrak{g}$-representation, this simplifies to
$$\alpha([\xi, \eta], \zeta) + \alpha([\eta, \zeta], \xi) + \alpha([\zeta, \xi], \eta) = 0$$

This is exactly the condition given in equation $(1)$ above.
So, we see that $\tau$ from the proposition is a cocycle in the Lie algebra cohomology.

Since the action in proposition is _weakly_ Hamiltonian, there may exist other functions $\xi \mapsto H_{\xi}$, these will all differ by a coboundary of the form
$$
\tau(\xi, \eta) = \sigma([\xi, \eta]).
$$

Therefore, we can see that given a weakly Hamiltonian action of $G$ on $M$, then we can find the associated equivalence class $[\tau] \in H^{2}(\mathfrak{g};\mathbb{R})$

This equivalence class measures "how far away" the action is to being Hamiltonian.

For example, if $[\tau] = 0$ (or vanishes) then $\{H_{\xi}, H_{\eta}\} = H_{[\xi, \eta]}$ and the comoment map is a Lie algebra homomorphism, so the action is Hamiltonian.

>[!NOTE] Homology measures obstruction
>Some authors call $H^{2}(\mathfrak{g};\mathbb{R})$ a measurement of obstructions to ALL weakly Hamiltonian actions being Hamiltonian, which is very intuitive.
