# Definition
A **multivector field** of degree $k$ on a [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]] $M$ is a smooth [[202404011123|section]] of the $k^{th}$ [[202404021520|exterior power]] of the [[202403092141|tangent bundle]].

$$ \vartheta \in \mathfrak{X}^{k}(M) \coloneq \Gamma\bigg(\bigwedge^{k}TM\bigg)$$

# Intuition and other identifications
First, we can remember the definition of a [[202404061628|differential $k$ form]] is a smooth section of the $k^{th}$ exterior power of the cotangent bundle.

$$\alpha \in \Omega^{k}(M) \coloneq \Gamma\bigg(\bigwedge^{k}T^{*}M\bigg)$$

Another way to think of (identify) a differential form of degree $k$ is as a multilinear, alternating map on the space of vector fields $\mathfrak{X}(M)$

$$ \alpha:\underbrace{\mathfrak{X}(M) \times \dots \times \mathfrak{X}(M)}_{k \ \text{times}} \longrightarrow C^{\infty}(M).$$

Or restating this pointwise we have
$$\alpha_{p}: \underbrace{T_{p}M \times \dots \times T_{p}M}_{k \ \text{times}} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$$

We can define multivector fields dually.

Just like we did for differential forms, we can identify these with multilinear, alternating maps

$$ \vartheta:\underbrace{\Omega^{1}(M) \times \dots \times \Omega^{1}(M)}_{k \ \text{times}} \longrightarrow C^{\infty}(M).$$

or written pointwise as
$$\vartheta_{p}: \underbrace{T_{p}^{*}M \times \dots \times T_{p}^{*}M}_{k \ \text{times}} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$$

Analogously to the construction of $\Omega^{\bullet}(M)$, multivector fields define a [[202404031510|graded commutative algebra]] structure. 

$$ \mathfrak{X}^{\bullet}(M) = \bigoplus_{k=0}^{\infty}\mathfrak{X}^{k}(M)$$

(Note that though the sum below says it goes on infinitely, above the dimension of the manifold, it is just adding zeros.)

This graded commutative algebra has the wedge product 

$$ \wedge: \mathfrak{X}^{k}(M) \times \mathfrak{X}^{l}(M) \longrightarrow \mathfrak{X}^{k+l}(M)$$
for multiplication.

The wedge product follows the formula

$$ (\alpha \wedge \beta)(v_{1}, \dots, v_{k+l}) = \sum_{\sigma \in \text{Sh}_{k}} \text{sgn}(\sigma) \alpha(v_{\sigma(1)}, \dots, v_{\sigma(k)})\beta(v_{\sigma(k+1)}, \dots, v_{\sigma(k+l)}).$$

# Local representation
A $k$-vector field can be represented locally as 

$$ X\big|_{U} = \sum_{i_{1}< \dots, i_{k}} X^{i_{1}, \dots, i_{k}}(x) \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i_{1}}} \wedge \dots \wedge \frac{\partial}{\partial X^{i_{k}}},$$

where $X^{i_{1}, \dots, i_{k}}(x)$ are uniquely determined smooth functions. 

# Relationship to derivations
Every vector field $X \in \mathfrak{X}^{1}(M)$ induces a [[202403061121|derivation]]
$$ \mathcal{L}_{X}:C^{\infty}(M) \to C^{\infty}(M).$$

We can make a similar multi-derivation for multivector fields defined as

$$ \mathcal{L}_{X}:C^{\infty}(M) \times \dots \times C^{\infty}(M) \longrightarrow C^{\infty}(M)$$

where

$$ \mathcal{L}_{X}(f_{1}, \dots, f_{k}) = X(\text{d} f_{1}, \dots, \text{d}f_{2})$$
## Proposition:
On any manifold $M$, the map $X \mapsto \mathcal{L}_{X}$ gives a $1-1$ correspondence
  
$$ \begin{Bmatrix} \text{multivector fields} \\ X \in \mathfrak{X}^{k}(M) \end{Bmatrix}
\leftrightarrow \begin{Bmatrix} \text{anti-symmetric multi-derivations} \\ \mathcal{L}:\underbrace{C^{\infty}(M)\times \dots \times C^{\infty}(M)}_{k \text{ times}} \to C^{\infty}(M)\end{Bmatrix}$$

### Proof
It is clear that for a multi-vector field $X$, $\mathcal{L}_{X}$ is a multiderivation that must be antisymmetric since $X$ is identified with an antisymmetric map.

__Injective__: Let $\mathcal{L}_{X} = \mathcal{L}_{W}$.
Thus,

$$X(df_{1}, \dots, df_{k}) = W(df_{1}, \dots, df_{k}) \qquad \forall f_{1}, \dots, f_{k} \in C^{\infty}(M).$$

We can consider functions $g_{1}, \dots, g_{n}$ such that $dg_{1},\dots, dg_{n}$ form a basis for $T_{p}^{*}M$.
Since $X$ and $W$ must match for these basis functions, they must match for all of $T_{p}^{*}M$.
These can be cycled through each position to show that $X = W$.

__Surjective:__ Let $D:C^{\infty}(M) \times C^{\infty}(M) \to C^{\infty}(M)$ be an antisymmetric $k$ multiderivation.

If we fix the last $k-1$ functions we get a derivation
$$ D(-, f_{2}, \dots, f_{k}):C^{\infty}(M) \longrightarrow C^{\infty}(M).$$

Since this is a derivation, this is isomorphic to some vector field with coefficients $D_{i}$
$$D(-, f_{2}, \dots, f_{k})(p) = \sum D_{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i}}\bigg|_{p}$$

We can do this with the other positions, but since the derivation is antisymmetric, we can take out the "diagonal" terms and combine the others to get
$$D(f_{1},\dots, f_{k}) =\sum_{i_{1}< \dots< i_{k}} D^{i_{1},\dots, i_{k}} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i_{1}}} \wedge \dots \wedge \frac{\partial}{\partial X^{i_{k}}}$$

for smooth functions $D^{i_{1}, \dots, i_{k}}$.

Therefore, since a $k$-vector field $X \in \mathfrak{X}^{k}(M)$ can be represented locally as
$$ X\big|_{U} = \sum_{i_{1}< \dots, i_{k}} X^{i_{1}, \dots, i_{k}}(x) \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{i_{1}}} \wedge \dots \wedge \frac{\partial}{\partial X^{i_{k}}},$$

let $X^{i_{1}, \dots, i_{k}}(x) = D^{i_{1},\dots, i_{k}}(x)$.

Therefore, $X \mapsto \mathcal{L}_{X}$ is surjective.
Hence, the relationship is 1-1.
