# Definition
A [[202407101429|group representation]] $G \to V$ is called **irreducible** if the only subrepresentations are $\{0\}$ and $V$. 

# Decomposition into irreducible representations
Every compact group representation can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible sub-representations. 

$$
V = \bigoplus_i V_i \qquad V_i \ \text{irreducible}
$$
