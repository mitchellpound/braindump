# quotient map

# Definition
For two [[20231220133911-topology|topological spaces]] X and Y, a quotient map $p:X \to Y$ is a *surjective* (important) map such that

$$ U \subset Y \ \text{open} \Leftrightarrow p^{-1}(U) \subset X \ \text{open} $$

# Notes
- A quotient map is always a [[20231222091508-continuous_map|continuous map]], since the quotient condition is stronger.
- If a map is continous and [[20240113170106-open_map|open]] (or closed) then it is a quotient map (but the converse it not always true)
