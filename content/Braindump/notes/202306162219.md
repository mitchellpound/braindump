# Bayesian network
A [[202306162201|Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM)]] that specifically uses a [[202306131124|Directed acyclic graph (DAG)]] to show conditional (causal) dependencies and represent the joint probability function. 

Formally is a pair 
$$
(\mathcal G, p)
$$
where $\mathcal G$ is a DAG and $p$ is a set (or family) of probability distributions. These are paired with the edges of the graph.
