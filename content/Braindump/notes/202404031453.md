# basis for exterior product
Given $\{v_1, \dots, v_n\}$ a basis for the vector space $V$, 

$$v_1 \wedge v_2 = -v_2 \wedge v_1$$
So by this, 
$$v \wedge v = - (v\wedge v) \implies v\wedge v = 0.$$
To make a basis for the [[202404021520|exterior product]], $\wedge^k(V)$, want no repeating vectors and none out of order (or else there would be redundancy in the basis)

The basis for $\wedge^k(V)$ is 
$$ \{v_{i_1}, \dots, v_{i_k} \ \big| 1 \leq i_1 < \dots < i_k \leq n\}$$

Therefore, 
$$\dim(\wedge^kV)= \binom{n}{k}.$$
