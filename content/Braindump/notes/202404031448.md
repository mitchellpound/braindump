# exterior algebra

$$ \bigwedge V \coloneqq \bigoplus_{k=0}^\infty \wedge^kV = \bigoplus_{k=0}^{\dim V} \wedge^k V$$
Where $\wedge^k$ is the [[202404021520|exterior product]]. 

This is an example of an [[202404031510|graded algebra]]. 
# "multiplication" in $\wedge V$ 
We can multiply vectors in $\wedge V$ by
$$(v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_k) \cdot (v_{k+1} \wedge \cdots \wedge v_{k+l}) = v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_{k+l}$$

Where $\cdot$ is usually denoted by $\wedge$.
