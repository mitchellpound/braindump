# Group action
A group action is a function that exploits symmetries in a space using group properties. 

# Definition
A **(left) group action** of a [[202403121554|group]] $G$ on a set $X$ is a function
$$ a:G \times X \longrightarrow X$$
that satisfies the following conditions:
$$a(e,x) = x$$
and 
$$ a(g_1 g_2, x) = a(g_2, a(g_1, x)) \qquad \forall x\in X, \text{and } g_1,g_2 \in G$$

We can define a right action... but literally everything I have used it for uses left actions... so I'll leave it for now. 
# Notation
Generally we denote action by putting the elements next to each other or with $\cdot$. 
For example, 
$$ g_1(g_2x) = (g_1g_2)x$$ or 
$$ g_1\cdot (g_2\cdot x) = g_1g_2 \cdot x$$
