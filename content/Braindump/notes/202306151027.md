# Discriminative model
A statistical model that does not make a general joint probability distribution like a [[202306151026|Generative model]] 

Instead, the posterior $P(Y|X)$ is modeled directly. In other words, a function/ mapping from the data $X$ to the probability of the label $Y$ is determined usually based on some parametric function. 

Example: Logistic regression
