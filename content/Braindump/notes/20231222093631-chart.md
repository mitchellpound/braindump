# chart

# Overview
A chart is a way to tie a [[20231220133911-topology|topological space]] back to the nice space of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (where $\dim(M) = n$) where the math is nice and follows usual linear algebra/ calculus.

# Definition
A chart is the data $(U, \phi)$ where $U \subset M$ for some topological space M with dimension M.
$\phi: U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ must be a [[20231222091508-continuous_map|continuous map]] that is a [[20231222092807-homeomorphism|homeomorphism]] on the image $\phi(U)$.

This means that the chart is a perfect map from the topological space to $\mathbb{R}^n$.
