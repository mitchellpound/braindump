# Overview
[[202407082223|Singular homology]] can be very hard to compute directly. 
Therefore, it is sometimes nice to "ignore" some parts of the topological space and make them trivial in some homology that is related. 
Relative homology is just that. 
It is the homology that comes from quotienting out the part of the homology that comes from a subspace

# Relative homology definition
Given a [[202407100948|pair]] $(X, A)$, we have 

$$\text{Sing}_n(A) \subset \text{Sing}_n(X) \implies C_n(A) \trianglelefteq C_n(X).$$

Therefore, we define the singular chains as 

$$C_n(X, A) = C_n(X) \bigg/ C_n(A)$$

For the boundary map, we can use the [[202407101014#Universal property|universal property of quotient groups]]

```tikz
\usepackage{tikz-cd}

\tikzcdset{scale cd/.style={every label/.append style={scale=#1},
    cells={nodes={scale=#1}}}}
	
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzcd}[scale cd=2, sep=huge]
C_n(X, A) \arrow[r, dashrightarrow, "\exists ! \ \partial"]& C_{n-1}(X, A)\\
C_n(X) \arrow[u, "q"] \arrow[r, "\partial"] & C_{n-1}(X) \arrow[u, "q"]\\
C_n(A) \arrow[u, hookrightarrow] \arrow[r, "\partial"] & C_{n-1}(A) \arrow[u, hookrightarrow]

\end{tikzcd}

\end{document}
```

Thus, $\big(C_\bullet(X, A), \partial \big)$ is the **relative singular chain complex**.

$H_\bullet(X, A)$ is the **relative homology of $(X, A)$**. 

# Chain maps
Note that since $i:A \hookrightarrow X$, we get [[202407080950|chain map]]

$$i_*:H_\bullet(A) \longrightarrow H_\bullet(X).$$

Similarly, since we have the quotient map $q$ between complexes, we get the chain map 

$$q_*:H_\bullet(X) \longrightarrow H_\bullet(X, A)$$

Next, we want to construct a new map

$$
\partial_n:H_n(X, A) \longrightarrow H_{n-1}(A)
$$

Let $x \in H_n(X, A)$. 
We can then pick a representative $[\sigma] \in Z_n(X, A)$. 
This is itself an equivalence class, so pick $\sigma \in C_n(X)$ which represents $[\sigma]$. 

We know that $\partial \sigma \in C_{n-1}(A)$, then $\partial \partial \sigma = 0$ 

> [!warning]- Boundary maps
> Note that technically the two boundary maps in $\partial \partial \sigma$ above are different boundary maps, since one is in $C_\bullet(A)$ and the other is in $C_\bullet(X)$ but we can bring them both into the higher space and get the same result

Thus, we define $\partial x = [\partial \sigma]$ 

> [!NOTE]+ $\sigma$ is well defined

# Relation to singular homology
There is a [[202407101046|exact sequence]] 

```tikz
\usepackage{tikz-cd}

\tikzcdset{scale cd/.style={every label/.append style={scale=#1},
    cells={nodes={scale=#1}}}}
	
\begin{document}

\begin{tikzcd}[scale cd=1.5, sep=huge]
& \dots \arrow[r]
\arrow[d, phantom, ""{coordinate, name=Z}]
& H_{n+1}(X,A) \arrow[dll,
"\partial", swap,
rounded corners,
to path={ -- ([xshift=2ex]\tikztostart.east)
|- (Z) [near end]\tikztonodes
-| ([xshift=-2ex]\tikztotarget.west)
-- (\tikztotarget)}] \\

H_n(A) \arrow[r, "i_n"]
& H_n(X)  \arrow[r, "q_n"]
\arrow[d, phantom, ""{coordinate, name=Z2}]
& H_n(X, A) \arrow[dll,
"\partial", swap,
rounded corners,
to path={ -- ([xshift=2ex]\tikztostart.east)
|- (Z2) [near end]\tikztonodes
-| ([xshift=-2ex]\tikztotarget.west)

H_{n-1}(A) \arrow[r, "i_n"]
& H_{n-1}(X)  \arrow[r, "q_n"]
\arrow[d, phantom, ""{coordinate, name=Z2}]
& H_{n-1}(X, A) \arrow[dll,
"\partial", swap,
rounded corners,
to path={ -- ([xshift=2ex]\tikztostart.east)

H_{n-1}(A)\arrow[r]&\dots&
