# Subjective OHMC
# Mix Optimal Hedge Monte Carlo with Bayesian Statistics
The Optimal Hedge Monte Carlo algorithm ([[@potters2001]]) gives an interesting way to price options based on fitting an optimal hedge based on a functional space.
Though the authors use an 'objective' (i.e. frequentist) distribution, it is agnostic to the distribution used to draw from. A Bayesian time-series can be used by drawing from the [[202306062133|posterior predictive density]] using the same objective function used.

This gives an options price for any type of option even with early exercise abilities based on the individual mental models of different agents.
