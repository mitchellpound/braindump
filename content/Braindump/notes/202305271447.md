# AR time series model
Autoregressive time series model. 
Uses past terms of the time series (with coefficients) to define present/ future behavior. 

$$y_t = a + \beta_1 y_{t-1} + \cdots + \beta_p y_{t-p} + \epsilon_t$$
or can be written using the lag operators as 
$$ (1-\beta_1L - \beta_2L^2 - \cdots - \beta_p L^p)y_t = c + \epsilon_t $$

Is a [[202305211417|stationary time series]] if the roots to the characteristic polynomial, 
$$ f(x) = 1-\beta_1x - \beta_2x^2 - \cdots - \beta_px^p $$
are outside the unit circle ($||x||<1$).
