# Free group action
A [[202405081540|group action]] of a [[202403121554|group]] on a set $X$ is called **free** (or **simple**) if for any $x \in X$ such that 
$$ gx = x \implies g = e$$
In other words, only the identity element maps a point to itself. 
For every other group element, the action moves the point around (it's not fixed).
