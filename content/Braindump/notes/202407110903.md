# Overview
Reduced homology is a modification of [[202407082223|singular homology]] so that the homology of a single point is always $0$, this makes some statements a little clearer and generalized axioms for homology to fit better. 

# Definition
For a [[20231220133911-topology|topological space]] $X$ and $x_0 \in X$, then the **reduced homology** of $X$ is 

$$\tilde{H}_\bullet(X) = H_\bullet(X, x_0)$$

where $H_\bullet(X, x_0)$ denotes the [[202407100953|relative singular homology]]. 

Note that for all $\bullet \geq 1$ then the reduced homology is the same as the usual homology. 
It can differ on $H_0$.
