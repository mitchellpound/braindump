# Smooth Manifold

# Overview
Is a special type of [[202403052130|topological manifold]] where the charts have compatible versions of calculus.

# Definition
A smooth manifold is a topological manifold $M$ such that for two charts $\phi_\alpha:U_\alpha \to \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\phi_\beta:U_\beta \to \mathbb{R}^n$ (defined on open sets $U_\alpha, U_\beta \subseteq M$) 
$$\phi_\beta \circ \phi_\alpha^{-1}\big|_{\phi_\alpha(U_\alpha \cap U_\beta)}: \phi_\alpha(U_\alpha \cap U_\beta) \subset \mathbb{R}^n \longrightarrow  \phi(U_\alpha \cap U_\beta)\subset \mathbb{R}^n$$
is smooth (i.e. $\phi_\beta \circ \phi_\alpha^{-1} \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with the necessary restrictions). 

Thus, where the domains of the charts overlap, we know "calculus works" and the smooth structure can vary between charts.
