# expected value
For a [[20240213222154-probability_space|probability space]] $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ and a random variable $X$, the expected value is defined as

$$
\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_\Omega X \ dP
$$

using the [[20240112111953-lebesgue_integral|Lebesgue integral]].

# Notes
Because this is defined using integration, then expected value is linear in terms of random variables and preserves order.
