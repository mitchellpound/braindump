# topology generated by basis

# Overview
Given a [[20231222084115-topological_basis|topological basis]], we can "generate" a [[20231220133911-topology|topology]] for that basis.

# Definition
For a set X and a basis $\mathcal{B}$, a set $U \subset X$ is an open set in the topology generated by the basis $\mathcal{B}$ (call it $\tau$) if
$$\forall x \in U, \exists B \in \mathcal{B} \quad x \in B \subset U$$

Note that the important part is that $B \subset U$. This is the condition that is 'hard', or not generally automatic.

# Proof that $\tau$ is a topology
1. $\emptyset$ and X come automatically.
2. Arbitrary union:
   let $U = \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} U_\alpha$ be an arbitrary union of open sets (i.e. $U_\alpha$ each follow above conditions)
   then $\forall x \in U$ $x \in B \subset U_\alpha \subset U$ so $U \in \tau$
3. Finite intersection:
   For $x \in U_1 \cap U_2$ open sets, so thus $x \in B_1 \subset U_1$ and $x \in B_2 \subset U_2$.
   Then by the 2nd condition of the definition of being a basis,
   $$x \in B_3 \subset B_1 \cap B_2 \subset U_1 \cap U_2$$
