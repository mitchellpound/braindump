# maximal ideal
An [[202404162353|algebra ideal]] $I \subset A$ is called **maximal** if $I \neq A$ and if $I \subseteq J \subsetneq A$ for an ideal $J$ then $I = J$. 

Can be thought of that there are no "larger" ideals containing $I$. 

### Note:
If $I$ is maximal, then the quotient $A/I$ is a [[202404171508|field]] with respect to addition and multiplication.
