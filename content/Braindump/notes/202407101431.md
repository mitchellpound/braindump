# Overview
A Lie group representation is a special case of a [[202407101429|group representation]]. 

# Definition
There are two ways to define/ think about Lie group representations. 
## Group action perspective
A **representation** of a [[202405061454|Lie group]] $G$ on a vector space $V$ is a continuous action 

$$\Phi:G \times V \longrightarrow V$$

such that for a fixed $g$, the map 

$$
\begin{split}
\varphi_g:V & \longrightarrow V\\
v &\longmapsto \Phi(g, v) = g\cdot v
\end{split}
$$

is linear.
## Group homomorphims perspective
Another perspective is that a **representation** is a smooth group homomorphism 

$$\Phi:G \longrightarrow \text{GL}(V).$$

# Morphisms
For representations $V$ and $W$, a **morphism** is a linear map $f:V\to W$ that is [[202405231417|equivariant]], i.e.

$$f(g \cdot v) = g\cdot f(v) \qquad \forall g \in G, v \in V.$$

We denote the set of all morphisms $\text{Hom}_G(V, W)$. 

Note $\text{Hom}_G(V, W) \subset \text{Hom}(V, W)$ is a linear subspace. 

# Subrepresentations 
For a representation $G \to V$, a linear subspace $U \subset V$ is a **subrepresentation** if it is $G$-invariant. 
That is if

$$g\cdot u \in U \qquad \forall g \in G,u \in U.$$

# Why is a representation a "module"?
