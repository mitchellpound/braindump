# Definition
Given an open set $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, a **$k$-dimensional slice** of $U$ is any subset of the form
$$
S = \{(x^1, \dots, x^k, x^{k+1}, \dots x^n) \in U \ | \ x^{k+1} = c^{k+1}, \dots, x^n = c^n\}.
$$
In words, the last $n-k$ coordinates of the subset are constant. 

Given a [[20231222093631-chart|chart]] $(U, \varphi)$ of a [[202403052130|manifold]] $M$, a subset $S \subset U$ is a **$k$-slice of U** given that $\varphi(S)$ is a slice of $\varphi(U)$. 

If $S\subset M$ is completely contained in the domain of a chart $(U, \varphi)$ such that $S \cap U$ is a slice in $U$ then we say that $(U, \varphi)$ is a **slice chart for S in M**.
