# Lie algebra of a Lie group
Every [[202405061454|Lie group]] has a [[202405062209|Lie algebra]] associated with it that is compatible with the Lie group structure.
This can be taken as a definition/ theorem. 

# Definition
For a Lie group $G$, we define
$$T_{e}G  = \text{Lie}(G)$$
 as the Lie algebra of $G$.
 It is generally denoted $\mathfrak{g}$.   

# Various constructions 
The Lie algebra as a vector space is fairly easy to understand. 
It is simply the [[202403251438|tangent space]] at the identity element of $G$. 
However, this does not tell us how the [[202405062213|Lie bracket]] acts on the Lie algebra. 
These are some constructions of the Lie bracket on $\mathfrak{g}$. 

## Using vector fields
Let $G$ be a Lie group, and let $\mathfrak{X}(G)$ denote the $\mathbb{R}$ vector space of [[202404011135|vector fields]] on $G$.
(For more info on this, look [[202405081435|here]]). 

However, $\mathfrak{X}(G)$ is not the Lie algebra of the Lie group $G$.
It is too big, so instead we can use the subspace of [[202405081440|left-invariant vector fields]]. 

The evaluation map
$$
\begin{split} \varphi: \mathfrak{X}_{L}(G) &\longrightarrow T_{e}G = \mathfrak{g}\\
X &\longmapsto X_{e}
\end{split}
$$
is a vector space isomorphism.
### Proof
#todo 

So thus, we can think of a left-invariant vector field $X \in \mathfrak{X}_{L}(G)$ as an element of the Lie algebra of $G$.
