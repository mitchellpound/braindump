# exterior derivative
The exterior derivative is a map that mimics/ generalizes the total derivative from multivariate calculus. 
Instead of just functions, it uses [[202404061628|differential forms]].
Its definition is motivated by the idea of finding a "closest linear approximation". 
# Definition
Let $M$ be a [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]]. 
The **exterior derivative** is the unique linear map 
$$
d:\Omega_m \longrightarrow \Omega_m
$$
that satisfies the following conditions: 
1. 
 $$
 d \circ d = 0
 $$ 
Doing it twice gives the zero map. 
2. 
$$
d(\Omega^k_M) \subseteq \Omega^{k+1}_M
$$
It doesn't respect the grading of the [[202404031510|graded algebra]] structure of $\Omega_M$
3. 
$$
d(\alpha \wedge \beta) = d\alpha \wedge \beta + (-1)^k \alpha \wedge d\beta
$$
Follows the Liebsnitz rule (with a graded enhancement). 
4. If $f \in \Omega^0_M = \mathcal{O}_M$, then $df \in \Omega^1_M$ is defined by $df_p \in T_p^*M$ by 
$$
\begin{split} df_p:T_pM &\longrightarrow \mathbb{R} \\
D &\longmapsto D([(M,f)])\end{split}
$$
In other words, given any derivation of local behavior, $df_p$ evaluates the derivation on $f$. 

# Notes
## derivative on smooth functions
For a smooth function $f\in \Omega^0(M)$ then 
$$
df_p = \sum \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\bigg|_p (dx_i)_p
$$
### Proof
For $p \in M$, let 
$$
\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1},\dots, \frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}\right\}
$$
be a basis for $T_pM$. 

For $f \in \Omega^0(M) = \mathcal{O}_M$, $df_p \in T_P^*M$. 
Therefore, 
$$
df_p = \sum a_i(dx_i)_p \qquad a_i \in \mathbb{R}
$$
where $(dx_i)_p$ is the [[202403251449|dual basis]] of $T_pM$, and $a_i$ are the unique coefficients from basis vectors. 

However, if we evaluate $df_p$ on the basis for $T_pM$ we get 
$$
df_p\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\bigg|_p\right) = a_i
$$
because of the the dual basis, and linearity. 

By the definition, and [[202403291458#Definition|4]] above 
$$
df_p\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\bigg|_p\right) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\bigg|_p\big([f]\big)
$$
