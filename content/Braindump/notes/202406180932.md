# Definition
Let $X$, $Y$ be [[20231220133911-topology|topological spaces]].
We call these spaces **homotopy equivalent** given there exists two maps $f:X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to X$ with homotopies

$$ G:f \circ g \sim id_x \qquad \text{and} \qquad H:g \circ f \sim id_y$$

# Notes
Homotopy equivalence is weaker than homeomorphism. 
Homeomorphism implies homotopy, since we can take the homotopies to be constant of the inverse maps. 

$X$ and $X \times [0,1]$ are homotopy equivalent, but $X \sim X \times(0,1)$ are also homotopy equivalent, so homotopy equivalence doesn't preserve compactness. 

Any star convex subset $S \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is homotopy equivalent to a point. 
We can take the homotopies to be the contraction down to a point and the "inverse" contraction that is an inclusion into $S$.
