# Submersion
Let $M$ and $N$ be [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifolds]] with dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively, and $F:M \to N$ a [[202405021216|smooth map]]. 
It is called a **submersion** at a point $x \in M$ if the [[202403092121|differential]] at $x$ is surjective.
Equivalently, if $\text{rank}_x(F) = n = \dim(N)$.
