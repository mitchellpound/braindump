# Definition
The subgroup of the [[202406151143|general linear group]]
$$ \text{O}(n) = \{A \in \text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R}) \ | \ A^{T}A = I\}$$
is called the **orthogonal group**.

The set $\text{SU}(n) \subset \text{O}(n)$ of matrices with determinant 1 is called the **special orthogonal group**.
(Note that orthogonal matrices all must have determinant $\pm 1$.)

Geometrically we can think of the elements of $\text{SO}(n)$ as rotations in $n$-dimensions and $\text{O}(n)$ are mixtures of rotations and reflections.

# Lie group structure
Using the same technique outlined in explanation for why the [[202406151158|unitary group]] is a [[202405061454|Lie group]], we can see that $\text{O}(n)$ is a [[202406170727|closed subgroup]]. 

## Lie algebra
Let $\mathfrak{so}(n)$ be the Lie algebra of $\text{O}(n)$ and $\text{SO}(n)$.

$$ \mathfrak{so}(n) = \{\text{skew-symmetric }n \times n \ \text{matrices}\}$$

Note the [[202405062209|Lie algebra]] of $\text{O}(n)$ and $\text{SO}(n)$ are the same because all skew-symmetric (real) matrices have trace 0.
