# Integrated process
Notation $y_t \sim I(n)$ 

The non-deterministic (AKA stochastic) part of the series is stationary when you take at least n differences ($I(0)$ denotes a [[202305211417|Stationary time series]]):

so for $y_t \sim I(n)$ then $\Delta^ny_t \sim I(0)$ 

An $I(n)$ series is n first differences away from being stationary 
Example: 
$$\ln P_t = c + \ln P_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$$
