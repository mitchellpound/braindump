# Compact space
A [[20231220133911-topology|topological space]] $X$ is called **compact** if for every open covering $\{U_\alpha\}$ has a finite subcovering. 

In other words, can we always find a way to "fill up" the space using a finite amount of open sets. 

# Examples
- $\mathbb{R}$ with the [[20231220142627-euclidean_topology|Euclidean topology]] is NOT compact. 
- $S^1$ is compact
