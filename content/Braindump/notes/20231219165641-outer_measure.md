# outer measure

# Definition
For a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$
$$|A| = \inf\{\sum_{k=1}^\infty \ell(I_k) \ | \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k \  \text{is an open covering of }A \}$$
Where $\ell(I_k)$ is the length of the interval
# Notes
The outer measure is NOT a [[20231218120406-measure|measure]] on the [[20231205121417-sigma_algebra]] the powerset of $\mathbb{R}$ because of the [[20231219170335-vitali_set|Vitali set]].
