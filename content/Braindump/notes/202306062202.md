# Bayesian prediction algorithm

1. Use Bayes rule to get posterior distribution $p(\theta| y^{obs})$ - can use sampling algorithm to approximate the distribution
2. Sample $\theta$ from posterior
3. Use sampled $\theta$'s (and $y^{obs}$ if you need to) to draw realizations from the distribution function $f_{\tilde{Y}|y^{obs}, \theta}$ - this is the 'new' likelihood function. 

These draws from this algorithm are from the [[202306062133|Posterior Predictive Distribution]]
