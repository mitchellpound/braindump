# Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
A model when the actual states of a [[202306161624|Markov chain]] is hidden or unobservable. 

Is a double stochastic process. 
- The hidden (actual) states of the Markov process 
- These hidden states produce observations based on a probability distribution $P(O_t|S_t)$ 

Note the observations only depend on the current state (in the basic model)
