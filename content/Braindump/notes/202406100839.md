# Implicit function theorem
Let $\mathcal{O} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ be open with $F: \mathcal{O} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ continuously differentiable. 
Also let $(x_0, y_0) \in \mathcal{O}$ such that $F(x_0, y_0) = 0$ and the $k \times k$ partial derivative matrix $D_yF(x_0, y_0)$ is invertible. 

Then, 
1. there exists $r> 0$ and an open ball $B = B_r(x_0)$ with a continuously differentiable map $G: B \to \mathbb{R}^k$ such that 

$$ F(x, G(x)) = 0 \qquad \forall x \in B$$

2. when $||x - x_0 ||< r$, $||y - y_0|| < r$, and $F(x,y)=0$ then 

$$y = G(x)$$ 
3.  
$$D_xF(x, G(x)) + D_yF(x, G(x)) \cdot DG(x) = 0 \qquad \forall x \in B$$
