# Cocreator with God

We often look to God for someone to intervene or make everything right. We want someone with all the answers to fix our problems. 

In contrast, God is looking for a cocreator to build His universe. He is looking for a collaboration, not to take (necessarily) take charge of everything. 

God wants us to become like Him, to co-create.
