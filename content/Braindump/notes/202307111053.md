# entrepreneurship adoption and state space
The division of labor occurs when different members of society have different comparative advantages. Thus, individual state/ action (policy) spaces cannot be the same and can change throughout time ([[202306281649|dynamic choice set]])

Similarly, different people will be 'observing' different things. This is how an entrepreneur can have 'notice' an opportunity and capitalize on it before others in society do. [[@high2009]]
