# Vector field
A vector field on a [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]] is a [[202404011123|section]] of the [[202403092141|tangent bundle]] $TM$. 
More intuitively it is a map that gives a tangent vector for every point in the manifold. 

# Definition
For a smooth manifold $M$, a vector field is a continuous map 
$$X: M \longrightarrow TM \qquad \text{s.t. } \qquad X(p) \in T_pM \quad \forall p \in M$$
# Types
If $X$ is a smooth map, we call it a smooth vector field (though these are usually what we study, so often they are just written as vector fields)
If $X$ is a vector field that isn't continuous, we call it a *rough vector field*. 

# Notes
Given a vector field, we can split it up into the basis vectors so
$$X_p = X^i(p) \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\bigg|_p $$
- The [[202405081435|space of all vector fields]] is a vector space
