# communication system advances human knowlege
Both the market system ([[@hayek1978a]]) and number systems that we have evolved to use ([[@harper2010]]) are systems that we use to communicate ideas faster and more effectively than we ever could otherwise. 

However, both systems end up allowing individual humans to become 'smarter' by the use of the system. Thus not only is knowlege assimilated through the system itself. It is also can have a profound affect on the individuals that the system. These affects may well beyond the effects that come from just hightened communication. 

TL;DR - systems for better communication end up doing more by allowing individual members to become smarter/ better - not just communicate better
