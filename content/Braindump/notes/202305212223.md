# Efficient Market Hypothesis
All information about a stock is incorporated into the price. There are no extra "insights", and the future price only depends on "news" which has to be stochastic since all known or relavant information about the stock has already been included. 

(Log) prices follow a random walk. 
$$ \ln P_t = c + \ln P_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$$
where $\epsilon|I_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$
