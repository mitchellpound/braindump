# Statement
Suppose $G$ is a [[202405061454|Lie group]] with an action on a [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]] $M$ that is smooth, [[202405081605|free]], and [[202405201025|proper]]. 
Then the [[202405231437|orbit space]] $M/G$ is a [[202403052130|topological manifold]] of dimension equal to $\dim M - \dim G$, and has a unique structure with the property that the projection map 
$$\pi:M \to M/G$$
is a smooth [[202405021547|submersion]]. 

## Proof
#todo 

# Notes
The open sets are easy to understand in $M/G$. 
It is constructed so that $\pi:M \to M/G$ is a [[20240113165510-quotient_map|quotient map]] so in the [[20240113171045-quotient_topology|quotient topology]], a set $V \subset M/G$ is open if $\pi^{-1}(V) \subset M$ is open. 

Also, if $G$ is [[202405201029|compact]], then the proper condition is unnecessary.
