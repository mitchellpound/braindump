# ACE simulation with subjective prices
# General idea
As apposed to general economics models that live inside [[202305110930|Neoclassical Equilibrium]], let the simulation run with "market prices" $P_m$ taken from a distribution and let it be "nudged" by buys and sells from agents.

Then let each agent derive their own [[20231104203132-subjective_asset_pricing|Subjective asset pricing]], $P_s$ and if $P_s \geq P_s + \epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is a transaction cost then the agent will buy more of the asset.

This gives a reason for an agent to buy something where they believe the market has mispriced the asset under their subjective model.
