# Integral curve
For a [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]] $M$, and a [[202404011135|vector field]] $X$, an **integral curve of $X$** is a [[202405081514|curve]] $\gamma:J \to M$ that "follows" the vector field. 
More formally, 
$$ \gamma^\prime(t) = X_{\gamma(t)} \qquad \forall t \in J$$
Thus, the direction (and magnitude) of the path matches the vector field at the point. 
# Maximal integral curve
An integral curve is **maximal** if there is no integral curve $\tilde{\gamma}:\tilde{J} \to M$ such that $J \subset \tilde{J}$. 
In other words, a maximal integral curve cannot be extended to an integral curve on a larger domain.
