# Global flow
A **(global) flow** is a continuous left $\mathbb{R}$-[[202405081540|action]] on a [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]] $M$. 

## Motivation
While this definition is technically correct, it doesn't leave any intuition. 
Given a [[202404011135|vector field]] $X$, a **(global) flow** is a function 
$$\Phi:\mathbb{R} \times M \to M$$
that "follows" [[202405081528|integral curves]] from points. 
We want these integral curves to be started from $0$, so 
$$\Phi(0, p) = p \qquad \forall p \in M$$
Then for a fixed $p \in M$ letting values of $t$ range through $\mathbb{R}$ would give the function 
$$ \Phi^{(p)} = \Phi(-, p):\mathbb{R} \longrightarrow M$$
which is a [[202405081514|curve]] on the M.
We want this curve $\Phi^{(p)}$ to be an integral curve of $X$. 

# Local flow
The only problem, is generally an integral curve $\gamma$ of $X$ with initial condition $\gamma(0) = p$ is not defined for all of $\mathbb{R}$. 
Therefore, we pick a special (open) subset $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R} \times M$ such that the integral curve we care about is defined on each set 
$$ \mathcal{D}^{(p)} = \{t \in \mathbb{R} \ | \ (t,p) \in \mathcal{D} \}.$$
This is called a **flow domain**. 

Then a **local flow** is a continuous map $\Phi: \mathcal{D} \to M$ that follows the same general structure as the global flow. 

# Maximal flows
A **maximal flow** is a flow where each $\mathcal{D}^{(p)}$ is a [[202405081528#Maximal integral curve|maximal integral curve]]. 
In other words, the flow domain cannot be made any bigger for any point $p \in M$. 

# Properties
- $\Phi_0 = Id_M$ 
- $\Phi_{t_1 + t_2} = \Phi_{t_1} \circ \Phi_{t_2}$ Thus, $t \mapsto \Phi_t$ is a group homomorphsim. 
- Flows commute if and only if the infinitesimal vector field [[202405281424|commutes]].
