# induced measure
#definition

For a [[20240108112059-measure_space|measure space]] $(X, \mathcal{S}, \mu)$ and a [[20231205121417-sigma_algebra]] $(Y, \mathcal{F})$, with a measurable function/ map $f:X \to Y$ the induced measure is

$$\mu \circ f^{-1}(U) $$

# Proof this is a [[20231218120406-measure|measure]]
1. $\mu(E) \geq 0 \ \forall E \in \mathcal{S} \ \implies \mu\big(f^{-1}(F)\big) \geq 0 \  \forall F \in \mathcal{F}$
2. $\mu\big(f^{-1}(\emptyset)\big) = 0$ because $f^{-1}(\emptyset) = \emptyset$
3. Countable additivity holds because for $E_1$ and $E_2$ disjoint, $f^{-1}(E_1)$ and $f^{-1}(E_2)$ are disjoint.
