# Posterior odds on a model
$$ P(M_j|y) = \frac{p(y|M_j)P_j}{\sum_{i=1}^J p(y|M_i)P_i}$$

A way to check among $J$ models which one has the best odds of being right.  Note this is just a meta version of Bayes Theorem

- $P(M_j|y)$ - Probability of model j being "the best" among all the choices
- $p(y|M_j)$ - The likelihood of the data under model j
- $P_j$ - Prior beliefs about the probability of model j being the best
- $\sum_{i=1}^J p(y|M_i)P_i$ - This is a weighted average of the likelihoods of the data under each model with the prior probabilities as weights - basically the expected value of the model mixture
