# derivation
A map $D: C^\infty \to \mathbb{R}$ is a **derivation** at a point $x$ if it is 
- linear
- follows the "Liebnitz rule" aka the product rule. For a point $x$,
$$
D(fg) = D(f)g(x) + f(x)D(g)
$$

If we don't look at a single point, instead look at all points on a [[202403052130|manifold]] we get that a derivation is a map 

$$D:C^\infty \to C^\infty$$
