# Regular point
For a [[202405021216|smooth map]] $F: M \to N$, a point $x\in M$ is called **regular** if $F$ is a [[202405021547|submersion]] at $x$. 
In other words, if $\text{rank}_x(F) = \dim N$, for the [[202405031329|rank of the smooth map]]. 

# Regular set 
Given the same setup as above, a set $U \subset M$ is called regular if every point $x \in U$ is a regular point.
