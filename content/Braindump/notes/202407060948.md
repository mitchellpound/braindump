# Overview
A simply connected space is one of the simplest [[20231220133911-topology|topological spaces]] that exists. 
This is because they can all be contracted via a [[20240112144635-homotopy|homotopy]] to a single point. 

# Definition
A path connected topological space $X$ is called **simply connected** if the [[202406180947|fundamental group]] is trivial.
That is 

$$\pi_1(X) = 0$$
