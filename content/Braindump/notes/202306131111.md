# Conditional Independence

$$P(A|B,C) = P(A|B)$$

Also 
$$P_{X,Y,Z}(x,y,z) = P_{X|Z}(x|z)P_{Y|Z}(y|z)P_Z(z)$$
This means that when controlling for the effects of $B$ then $C$ doesn't have any new information about $A$ (they are independent) 

Conditional independence doesn't mean that two events are independent. They are only independent given information about $B$. They still may be strictly dependent. 

### Notation
$$A \perp C|B \quad or \quad X \perp Y|Z $$
