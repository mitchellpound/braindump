# vector bundle 
Informally, a vector bundle is a collection of vector spaces that lie above each point in a manifold. 
They really would have been better named vector space bundle... but oh well. 
We attach a vector space to each point $x \in M$ for some [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]], [[202403052130|topological manifold]], or even an abstract [[20231220133911-topology|topological space]]. 

# Formal definition
Note the definition here is for a smooth manifold, but this same construction can be used for other categories.
A vector bundle is the data $(E,M,\pi, k)$, for $E, M$ smooth manifolds with a smooth map 
$$ \pi: E \longrightarrow M,$$
such that for every point $p \in M$, there exists an open neighborhood $U \subset M$ and a smooth map 
$$\varphi:\pi^{-1}(U) \longrightarrow U \times \mathbb{R}^k$$
such that 

1. 
```tikz
\usepackage{tikz-cd}
\usepackage{amsfonts}

\tikzcdset{scale cd/.style={every label/.append style={scale=#1},
    cells={nodes={scale=#1}}}}
	
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzcd}[scale cd=2, sep=huge]
\pi^{-1}(U) \arrow[rr, "\varphi"] \arrow{dr}[left]{ \pi\big|_{\pi^{-1}(U)}} & {} & U \times \mathbb{R}^k \arrow[dl, "\sigma"] \\
& U &
\end{tikzcd}

\end{document}
```

commutes. 
So we want points in the vector bundle above the open set and in $U \times \mathbb{R}^k$ to get mapped to each other. 
Basically, we understand the vector bundle using $U \times \mathbb{R}^k$ since we know what that looks like. 

2. $\forall p \in M$, 
$$\varphi\big|_{\pi^{-1}(\{p\})}:\pi^{-1}\big(\{p\}\big) \longrightarrow \sigma^{-1}\big(\{p\}\big) = \{p\}\times \mathbb{R}^k$$
is a vector space isomorphism. 
So we can think of the vector space attached to a point as being just $\mathbb{R}^k$.
