# maximal smooth atlas
An atlas is a collection of [[20231222093631-chart|charts]] that cover the entire [[202403052130|topological manifold]]. 
A smooth atlas includes a condition that the overlap of charts be compatible with calculus how we know it in $\mathbb{R}$. 

# Definition
A maximal smooth atlas for the manifold $(M, n)$ is 
$$\mathcal{A} = \{\varphi_i:U_i \to V_i \quad U_i \subset M, V_i \subset \mathbb{R}^n \ \text{open} \}_{i\in I} $$
such that 
1. $\cup U_i = M$
2. $\forall i,j \in I$, the map $\varphi_i \circ \varphi_j^{-1}: \varphi_i(U_i \cap U_j) \to \varphi_j(U_i \cap U_j)$ is smooth. 
	Note we only care about the intersections. 
	If something lives outside the intersections, i.e. it is only in the "middle" of a chart, then the calculus already works well because it is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ inside this openset. 
	In other words, we want calculus to work nice as we move between charts. 
3. Maximality - nothing is left out. 
	Given a homeomorphism $\varphi^\prime: U^\prime \to V^\prime$ between open sets in $M$ and $\mathbb{R}$, such that 
	$$\begin{align}&\forall \varphi \in \mathcal{A} \\
		\varphi^\prime \circ \varphi^{-1}&: \varphi(U \cap U^\prime) \to \varphi^\prime(U \cap U^\prime) \\
		&\text{and}\\
		\varphi \circ (\varphi^\prime)^{-1}&: \varphi^\prime(U \cap U^\prime) \to \varphi(U \cap U^\prime) \\
		\end{align}$$
	are smooth maps, then $\varphi^\prime \in \mathcal{A}$.
	Said another way, if we happen to find some other smooth chart that works with the smooth manifold structure, then we can assume that it was already in $\mathcal{A}$.
