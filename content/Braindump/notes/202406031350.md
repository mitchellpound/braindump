# Effective action 
A [[202405081540|group action]] on a set $X$ is called **effective** (or **faithful**) if for an element $g \in G$, 
$$ g \cdot x = x \quad \forall x \in X \implies g = e_G$$

In other words, there is no trivial action other than the identity element. 

Note, this is not the same as a [[202405081605|free group action]], which is a stronger condition.
