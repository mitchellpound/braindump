# Society members as observations
#paperidea
An interesting idea would be to have other members of society be an observation modality, while the required observatons that an entrepreneur is aware of with the 'origianal' idea [[@high2009]] are not in that agent's observation space. 

In other words, run a simulation where an agent can observe others, but cannot come up with the original idea themselves. Does adoption occur? What happens when two agents both 'discover' something different?
