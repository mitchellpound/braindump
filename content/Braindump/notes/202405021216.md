# Smooth map
A smooth map is a morphism in the category of smooth manifolds. 
It is a map between smooth manifolds that preserves smooth structure. 

# Definition
A map $F:M \to N$ between [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifolds]] is called a **smooth** if for all [[20231222093631-chart|charts]] $(U, \phi)$ of $M$ and $(V, \psi)$ of $N$ such that $F(U) \subset V$ the map 
$$ \psi \circ F \circ \phi^{-1} \phi(U) \longrightarrow \psi(V)$$ is smooth. 

Note, this makes sense, since we don't know how to take derivatives on $M$ by itself. 
So if we use the charts to get back to $\mathbb{R}^n$ then we can use the Jacobian and do calculus the way we know and love. 
Picture (without necessary restrictions to open sets):

```tikz
\usepackage{tikz-cd}
\usepackage{amsfonts}

\tikzcdset{scale cd/.style={every label/.append style={scale=#1},
    cells={nodes={scale=#1}}}}
	
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzcd}[scale cd=2, sep=huge]
M \arrow[r, "F"] \arrow[d, "\phi"] & N \arrow[d, "\psi"] \\
\mathbb{R}^m \arrow[r, "\psi \circ F \circ \phi^{-1}", dashed] & \mathbb{R}^n

\end{tikzcd}

\end{document}
```
