# Infinitesimal generators of flows
Given a [[202405081538|flow]] on a manifold $M$ we want to know what vector field $X$ could have "made" that flow so the [[202405081528|integral curves]] follow $X$. 

# Definition
For a flow $\Phi:\mathbb{R} \times M \to M$ (or $\mathcal{D} \to M$), for each $p \in M$ let 
$$X_p = {\Phi^{(p)}}^\prime(0) $$
This is the **infinitesimal generator of $\Phi$**. 
## Motivation
This makes sense because for a flow, we know that $\Phi(0, p) = p$, and we want $\Phi^{(p)}$ to be an integral curve, thus we need the vector field at $p$ 
$X_p$ to be set equal to the [[202405081517|velocity vector of the curve]]. 
# Smoothness of generators
If $\Phi:\mathbb{R} \times M \to M$ (or $\mathcal{D} \to M$), is a smooth flow on a [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]] $M$ then the infinitesimal generator of $\Phi$ is a smooth vector field.
