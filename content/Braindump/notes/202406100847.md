# Inverse function theorem
Let $\mathcal{O} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be open and $F:\mathcal{O} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be continuously differentiable. 
Let $x_*\in \mathcal{O}$ be a point where
$$DF(x_*)$$ is invertible. 

Then there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x_*$ and a neighborhood $V$ of $F(x_*)$ such that the restriction 
$$F|_U:U \to V$$

is a bijection and $F^{-1}:V \to U$ is continuously differentiable and for $y \in V$ with $F(x) = y$ then 

$$DF^{-1}(y) = [DF(x)]^{-1}$$
