# Literature Notes
A really good, in-depth and _very_ explicit explanation of a POMDP version of an Active Inference model, and how to solve it as well as how to learn it. Comes with a billion citations to follow and MATLAB code. 

Model inversion is about starting with a defined relationship between states to observations then inferring states from observations (from causes to consequences infer causes from consequences).
