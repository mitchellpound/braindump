# Literature Notes
# Math in general
Math (should) be computational. He gave the example of small rules that explain propogation of black and white pixels. Some rules produced repeatable patterns or fractals. Some produced non repeating "patterns", thus the only way study them is computationally - simulating the whole thing.
## Computaional irreducibility
The idea that somethings can't be reduced to simple equations like generating functions, or differential equations. Some propogation rules have to be computed all the way in order to see the end result. *Computation is necessary*

# Universe
The universe is discrete, with (fairly) simple rules of how it propogates. Thus, things we are used to studying in physics like relativity, quantum phenomena are emergent properties of the propogation of the hyper graph.
