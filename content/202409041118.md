# Defintion
A [[202405231344|symplectic action]] of $G$ on $(M,\omega)$ is called **weakly Hamiltonian** if every [[202405231250|fundamental vector field]] $X_{\xi}$ is a [[202405231223|Hamiltonian vector field]].

# Obstructions to being (fully) Hamiltonian
If an action is weakly Hamiltonian, there is no restriction on the "way" you find functions that are the Hamiltonian functions are assigned to [[202405231250|fundamental vector fields]].
As opposed to [[202405231352|Hamiltonian actions]], there is no requirement for the [[moment map]] (used the term loosely) to be equivariant, or equivalently that the co-moment map is a Lie algebra homomorphism (also see [[202409031613|equivariance of moment map]]).
