# Definition
Given a compact group $G$, with [[202407101429|representation]] $V$ and $W$. 
Let $W$ be [[202407111431|irreducible]]. 

Then $\dim_\mathbb{C}\text{Hom}_G(W, V)$ is called the **multiplicity** of $W$ in $V$. 

# Intuition
Why is this somewhat esoteric seeming number called the multiplicity? 

$V$ can be decomposed into irreducible submodules

$$
V = \bigoplus_i V_i.
$$

Therefore, 

$$
\text{Hom}_G(W, V) = \text{Hom}_G(W, \oplus_i V_i) = \bigoplus_i \text{Hom}_G(W, V_i).
$$
