# Smooth embedding
If $M$ and $N$ are [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifolds]], a **smooth embedding** is a [[202405021216|smooth map]] $F: M \to N$ that is a [[202405021603|topological embedding]] and is a smooth [[202405021557|immersion]]. 

Note, this is not just a topological embedding that is also smooth, this is a stronger condition.
