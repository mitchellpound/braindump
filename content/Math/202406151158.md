# Definition
The subgroup
$$\text{U}(n) = \{A \in \text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{C}) \ | \ A^{*}A = I\}$$
is called the **unitary group.

The set $\text{SU}(n) \subset \text{U}(n)$ of unitary matrices with determinant 1 are called the special unitary group.

# Importance
Unitary matrices preserve the Hermetian inner product.

Additionally, $U(1)$ is isomorphic to the [[20240113171559-torus|torus]] $S^1$. 

# Lie group structure
We can write each entry of the matrix multiplication

$$ (A^{*}A)_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n}\overline{A_{ki}}A_{kj}$$

Thus, this is a continuous function, and we can consider the inverse image of the closed set where

$$ \begin{cases} (A^{*}A)_{ij} = 1 & i=j \\ (A^{*}A)_{ij}=0 & i \neq j \end{cases}.$$

Since the set above is closed (it consists of one "point'' in $\mathbb{R}^{n^{2}}$ or one matrix depending on how you choose to look at it), so thus the inverse image, which is $\text{U}(n)$ is also closed.

Note that $\text{SU}(n) = \text{U}(n) \cap \text{SO}(n)$ so it is clearly closed as well.

Therefore, by the [[202406170727|closed subgroup theorem]], $\text{U}(n)$ and $\text{SU}(n)$ is a [[202405061454|Lie group]]. 

## Lie algebra $\mathfrak{u}(n)$
Let $\mathfrak{u}(n)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(n)$ be the [[202405062209|Lie algebra]] for $\text{U}(n)$ and $\text{SU}(n)$, respectively.

$$ \mathfrak{u}(n) = \{A \in \text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{C}) \ | \ A^{*} = -A\} = \{\text{skew-Hermitian }n \times n \ \text{matrices}\}$$

and

$$ \mathfrak{su}(n) =\{\text{skew-Hermitian }n \times n \ \text{matrices with trace}= 0 \}$$
