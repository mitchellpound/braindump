# Definition
Let $R$ be a commutative [[202404171457|ring]]. 
An **$R$-algebra** is a ring homomorphism $\alpha:R \to S$ such that $\alpha(R)$ is contained in the center of $S$. 

That is, 
$$
\alpha(r)s = s\alpha(r) \qquad \forall r \in R, s \in S.
$$


# As an $R$-algebra


# Relationship to other algebras
When $R$ is a field this notion corresponds to an [[202404162325|associative algebra]], which can be thought of as a vector space with a vector multiplication operation. 

Why are these two the same? 

| Associative algebra   | $R$-algebra<br>$\alpha:R \to S$            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| vector addition       | addition in $S$ using ring structure       |
| vector multiplication | multiplication in $S$ using ring structure |
| scalar multiplication | $\alpha(r)$ the action on $R$              |
