# tail field
#definition
A tail field is a way to look at events that that happen arbitrarily far down an infinite sequence of events.
# Definition
For a [[20240213222154-probability_space|probability space]] $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$, let $\mathcal{F}_1, \mathcal{F}_2, \dots \subset \mathcal{F}$ be a sequence of sigma algebras generated by events.
The *tail field* is the [[20231205121417-sigma_algebra]]

$$ \mathcal{T} = \bigcap_{m=1}^\infty \sigma \left(\bigcup_{n=m}^\infty \mathcal{F}_n \right)$$
