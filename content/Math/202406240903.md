# Statement
Let $X$ be a [[20231220133911-topology|topological space]] such that it can be decomposed into open sets 
$$X = \bigcup_\alpha U_\alpha$$
such that 
- each open set contains the basepoint $x_0 \in U_\alpha$ 
- $U_\alpha$ is open and path-connected
- $U_\alpha \cap U_\beta$ is path-connected
- $U_\alpha \cap U_\beta \cap U_\gamma$ is path-connected

Then 
$$\pi_1(X) \simeq 
{\prod_\alpha}^*\pi_1(U_\alpha) \bigg/ \langle {j_{\beta}}_* [\gamma]{j_{\alpha}}_*[\gamma]^-1 \ | \ \gamma \in \pi_1(U_\alpha \cap U_\beta) \,\,\, \forall \alpha, \beta\rangle$$

Note ${j_\alpha}_*$ is the pushforward along the inclusion as seen in the diagram below.

 & U_\beta \arrow[ur, hookrightarrow, "i_\beta"] &

# Examples
## Wedge sum
Let $I$ be a set (e.g. $\{1,2\}$). 
Let 
$$ \bigvee_I S^1 = \bigsqcup_{i\in I}S^1_i \bigg/ \begin{array}1 \text{glue together all points }\\(0,1) \ \text{on each }S^1\end{array}$$
This is called the _wedge sum_. 

Let $U_i = S_i^1 \bigcup_j \text{small open set of each }(1,0)\in S^1_j$. 

$U_i \cap U_j$ are path connected and $\pi_1 \simeq 0$, since they are a bunch of curved lines connected in the "middle" at a point they are contractible. 

Thus, 
$$\pi_1\left(\bigvee S^1\right) = {\prod_{s \in I}}^*\mathbb{Z}\cdot s$$
