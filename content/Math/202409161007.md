# (Informal) definition
A **class** is a collection of (mathematical) constructions/ objects with a shared property. 

# Necessity of classes
In set theory, the set of all sets becomes somewhat messy and gives rise to several paradoxes. 
To avoid this, we can think of classes as a set-like object that isn't a set to avoid paradoxes. 

Thus, while there is no set of all sets, there is a class of all sets.
