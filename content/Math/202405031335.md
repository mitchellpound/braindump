# Regular value
For a [[202405021216|smooth map]] $F: M \to N$, a point $y\in N$ is called a **regular value** if $F$ is a [[202405021547|submersion]] at all points $x \in F^{-1}(\{y\})$. 
In other words, if the level set at $y$ is regular, or the restriction to the level set is a global submersion. 

By [[202405031329#Set of max rank|this proposition]], each level set of a regular value is open.
