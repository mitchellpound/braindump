# Overview
A chain map is a morphism in the category of [[202407080919|chain complexes]]. 
It is a map that preserves the differential between the abelian groups. 

# Definition
A **chain map** $f_\bullet:A_\bullet \to B_\bullet$ is a function between [[202407080919|chain complexes]] such that 

1. $f_n:A_n \to B_n$ is a [[202404301514|group homomorphism]]. 
2. $f$ is "$d$-linear". That means the following diagram commutes.
```tikz
\usepackage{tikz-cd}

\tikzcdset{scale cd/.style={every label/.append style={scale=#1},
    cells={nodes={scale=#1}}}}
	
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzcd}[scale cd=2, sep=huge]
A_n \arrow[r, "d"] \arrow[d, "f_n"] & A_{n-1} \arrow[d, "f_{n-1}"] \\
B_n \arrow[r, "d"] & B_{n-1} 
\end{tikzcd}

\end{document}
```

# Connection to homology
A chain map $f_\bullet:A_\bullet \to B_\bullet$ induces a homomorphisms of graded abelian groups 

$$Z_\bullet(f):Z_\bullet(A) \longrightarrow Z_\bullet(B)$$

such that there is an induced map 

$$B_\bullet(f_\bullet):B_\bullet(A) \longrightarrow B_\bullet(B)$$

in particular 

$$H_\bullet(f_\bullet):H_\bullet(A) \longrightarrow H_\bullet(B)$$

In short, a chain map induces a homomorphims between [[202407080925|homology]] groups for a chain complex.
