# Definition
Given [[202405081540|group actions]] of $G$ on $X$ and $G$ acting on $Y$, and **equivariant map** $f:X \to Y$  is a map with the property 

$$f(g\cdot x) = g \cdot f(x) \qquad \forall g \in G, x \in X.$$

# Relations to topics
Note that an equivariant map defines a morphism between two [[202405081540|G-sets]].
