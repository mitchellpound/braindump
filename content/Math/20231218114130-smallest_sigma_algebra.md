# smallest $\sigma$-algebra

# Intersections of $\sigma$-algebras
For a set X and set $\mathcal{A}$ of subsets of X. The intersection of [[20231205121417-sigma_algebra]]s  containing $\mathcal{A}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.

## Proof:
Let $\mathcal{S}_0$ be the intersection of all the $\sigma$-algebras containing $\mathcal{A}$
1. $\emptyset \in \mathcal{S}_0$
   Since $\emptyset$ is in each $\sigma$-algebra by definition it must be in the intersection.
2. $E$ \in $\mathcal{S}_0 \implies E^C \in \mathcal{S}_0$
   Since E is in each $sigma$-algebra, then $E^C$ is in each - thus it is in the intersection.
3. Countable union by the same logic...

# The smallest $\sigma$-algebra
The intersection of all $\sigma$ -algebras containing a set A is called the smallest $\sigma$ -algebra containing A.
