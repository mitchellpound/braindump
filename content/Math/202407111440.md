# Definition
Given a compact group $G$, with [[202407101429|representation]] $V$ and $W$. 
Let $W$ be [[202407111431|irreducible]]. 

Then $\dim_\mathbb{C}\text{Hom}_G(W, V)$ is called the **multiplicity** of $W$ in $V$. 

# Intuition
Why is this somewhat esoteric seeming number called the multiplicity? 

$V$ can be decomposed into irreducible subrepresentations

$$
V = \bigoplus_i V_i.
$$

Therefore, 

$$
\text{Hom}_G(W, V) = \text{Hom}_G(W, \oplus_i V_i) = \bigoplus_i \text{Hom}_G(W, V_i).
$$

We know from [[202407111445|Schur's Lemma]] that 
$$
\dim_\mathbb{C}\text{Hom}_G(W, V_i) = \begin{cases}1 & W \cong V_i \\ 0 & W\ncong V_i\end{cases}
$$

Therefore, the multiplicity tells us how many times $W$ is isomorphic to one of the subrepresentations $V_i$, or in other words, how many times does $W$ "show up" in the decomposition of $V$.
