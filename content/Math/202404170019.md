# finitely generated algebra
We call an [[202404162325|algebra]] $A$ **finitely generated** if $A = (S)$ for a finite subset $S$. 
This is important, because it tells us how to "build" the algebra from just a finite set of pieces. 

Example: $\mathbb{C}[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ is finitely generated by $x_1, \dots, x_n$. 

It is interesting to note that unlike dimension, which plays nice with subspaces, we can find a subalgebra of a finitely generated algebra that is not finitely generated. 

For example, consider $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ and the subalgebra $\mathbb{C}[xy, xy^2, xy^3, \dots]$. 
this subalgebra is not finitely generated.
