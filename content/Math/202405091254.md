# The Fundamental Theorem on Flows
Every smooth vector field on a smooth manifold has a unique smooth maximal flow with some nice properties. 

## Formally
Let $X$ be a smooth [[202404011135|vector field]] on a [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]] $M$. 
There exists a unique [[202405081538|flow]] $\Phi_X:\mathcal{D} \to M$ whose [[202405091251|infinitesimal generator]] is $X$. 
This flow has the properties that 
1. $\Phi_X^{(p)}$ is the unique maximal [[202405081528|integral curve]] of $X$ with $\Phi_X^{(p)}(0) = p$ 
2. If $s \in \mathcal{D}^{(p)}$, then $\mathcal{D}^{(\Phi_X(s,p))}$ is the interval $\mathcal{D}^{(p)} - s = \{t-s \ | t \in \mathcal{D}^{(p)}\}$. 
	In this way, "following the integral curve" by a value of $s$ shifts the domain of where the new integral curve is defined on by $s$. 
3. For each $t \in \mathbb{R}$, the set 
$$ M_t = \{p \in M \ | \ (t,p) \in \mathcal{D}\}$$
	of all points in $M$ that where an integral curve is defined for $t$ is _open_.
4. The function $\Phi_t:M_t \to M_{-t}$ is a diffeomorphism with inverse $\Phi_{-t}$ .
