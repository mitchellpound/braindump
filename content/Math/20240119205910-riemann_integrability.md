# Riemann integrability

There are several ways to characterize if it's possible to take a Riemann integral.

# With upper and lower sums
A function is integrable if the [[20240112110909-riemann_lower_upper_sum|Riemann lower]] and upper sum are equal.

# Using continuity
Riemann integrabile $\iff$ continous almost everywhere

One of the coolest ways to check this is using the [[20240119213301-continuity_with_limsup|continuity with limsup]] and liminf functions

i.e. the function is Riemann integrable iff $|\{x| h(x) \neq H(x)\}| = 0$
