# Topological embedding
Let $X$ and $Y$ be [[20231220133911-topology|topological spaces]] and $f: X \to Y$ be a continuous map. 
$f$ is called an **embedding** if it is a homeomorphism on $\text{im}(f)=Z$. 
Slightly more rigourously, if 
$$ 
\begin{split}
\hat{f}:X &\longrightarrow Z\\
x &\longmapsto f(x)
\end{split}
$$
is a homeomorphism (restricting the domain) then $f$ is an embedding. 

# Examples
Consider $f:[0, 1) \to \mathbb{C} = \mathbb{R}^2$ where $f(x) = e^{2\pi x}$. 
This is an embedding since $f:[0,1) \to S^1$ is a homeomorphism.
