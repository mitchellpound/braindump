# Overview
Two continuous maps are homotopic if (informally) we can continuously deform one into the other.
We do this by adding another parameter that varies along an interval that "shows" the deformation.

# Definition
For two [[20231222091508-continuous_map|continuous maps]] $f, g:X \to Y$, we say $f$ is **homotopic** to $g$ if there is a continuous map

$$F:X \times I \to Y$$

Such that
$$F(x,0) = f(x) \ \text{and} \ F(x,1) = g(x)$$

We call $F$ a **homotopy**.
