# metric topology

Given a set X with a [[20240113120111-metric|metric]] $d$, the if the collection of open balls

$$B_d(x, \epsilon) = \{y| \ d(x,y) < \epsilon \}$$

is a [[20231222084115-topological_basis|topological basis]] then the [[20231220133911-topology|topological space]] is called the metric topology
