# Definition
Given [[202409161019|categories]] $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$, a [[202409162145|functor]] $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ is called **essentially surjective** if for all $Z \in \mathcal{D}$ there exists an $X \in \mathcal{C}$ such that $F(X)$ and $Z$ are isomorphic in $\mathcal{D}$.
