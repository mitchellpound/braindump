# Overview
Given a [[202406282205|cover]] and a continuous map from a topological space to the base, a natural question to ask would be if the map can be lifted to the cover. 

# Statement
Let $f:(Y, y_0) \to (X, x_0)$ be a continuous map of pointed spaces and $p:(E, e_0) \to (X, x_0)$ a [[202406282205|cover]]. 

There exists a lift of $f$ to $E$ if and only if $f_*\pi_1(Y,y_0)$ is a subgroup of $p_*\pi_1(X, x_0)$ (the [[202406282251|induced subgroup from cover]]). 

Consider the following diagram:
```tikz
\usepackage{tikz-cd}

\tikzcdset{scale cd/.style={every label/.append style={scale=#1},
    cells={nodes={scale=#1}}}}
	
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzcd}[scale cd=2, sep=huge]
& (E, e_0) \arrow[d, "p"]\\
(Y, y_0)\arrow[ur, dashrightarrow] \arrow[r, "f"] & (X, x_0)
\end{tikzcd}

\end{document}
```
