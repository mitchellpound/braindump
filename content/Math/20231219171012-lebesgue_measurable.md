# Lebesgue measurable
# Intuition
Kind of what is sounds like... a set that can be measured by the [[20231219170539-lebesgue_measure|Lebesgue measure]].
However, it is not just the sets in the [[20231218115557-borel_sigma_algebra]], but it is up to null sets.

# Formal definition
A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is Lebesgue measurable if $\exists B \subseteq A$ such that $|A\backslash B| = 0$

# Notes
Sets that are Lebesgue sets and not Borel sets are really hard to find.
