# Velocity vectors
For a [[202405081514|curve]] $\gamma:J \to M$ on a [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]], the **velocity of $\gamma$** at $t_0 \in J$ is the [[202403092121|differential]] 
$$\gamma^\prime(t_0) = d\gamma\left(\frac{d}{dt}\bigg|_{t_0}\right) \in T_{\gamma(t_0)}M$$


# Coordinate version
Given a [[20231222093631-chart|chart]] $(U, \phi)$  with coordinate functions $x^i$, we can define 
$$
\gamma(t)= (\gamma^1(t), \dots, \gamma^n(t))
$$
using these coordinates (for $t \in U$ sufficiently close to $t_0 \in U$). 

Using this coordinatized version, we can see that by the chain rule
$$
\gamma^\prime(t_0) = \frac{d\gamma^i}{dt}(t_0)\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\bigg|_{\gamma(t_o)}
$$

Note, this is exactly what we would think it is. 
It is very similar to what happens with a curve in Euclidean space, which is just the derivative of each of the components.
