# tangent bundle
The tangent bundle is a [[202403092143|vector bundle]] that contains all the [[202403251438|tangent spaces]] of all the points in the manifold. 

# Definition
$$TM = \{(p,v) \big| p\in M, v \in T_pM \}$$
Or, if you like arbitrary unions, 
$$TM = \bigsqcup_{p \in M} T_pM$$

# Manifold structure
If $M$ is a smooth manifold with $\dim M = n$, then $TM$ has a smooth manifold structure and has $\dim TM= 2n$.
