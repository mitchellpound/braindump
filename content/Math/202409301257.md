# Definition
An action of an object $X$ on an object $Y$ of a [[202409161019|category]] $\mathcal{C}$ is a homomorphism 
$$ 
\mathcal{A}:X \longrightarrow \text{Aut}_\mathcal{C}(Y)
$$

Note, this requires $X$ to have some sort of compatible structure with $\text{Aut}_\mathcal{C}(Y)$. 
There is generally a lot of structure from $\text{Aut}_\mathcal{C}(Y)$, so this is not impossible to find interesting examples.
