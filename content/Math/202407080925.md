# Overview 

# Definition
Recall the definitions of cycles and boundaries:
![[202407080928#Definition of cycles]]

![[202407080931#Definition of boundaries]]

There is a graded abelian group $H_\bullet(A)$ with 

$$H_n(A) \coloneqq Z_n(A) \bigg/ B_n(A)$$

$H_n(A)$ is called the **n-th homology group of A**. 

Or written more succintly, the homology of a complex $(A_\bullet, d_\bullet)$ is the graded abeilian group (or [[202409301254|R-module]]) $H_\bullet(A_\bullet, d_\bullet)$ with 
$$
H_i(A_\bullet, d_\bullet) = \ker(A_i \xrightarrow{d_i}A_{i+1}) \big/\text{im}(A_{i+1} \xrightarrow{d_{i+1}} A_i)
$$
