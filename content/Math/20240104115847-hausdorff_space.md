# Hausdorff space
#definition
# Definition
For a [[20231220133911-topology|topological space]] $(X, \tau)$ it is called Hausdorff if for distinct points $x \neq y$ then there exits disjoint open sets $U,V \in \tau$ such that $x \in U$ and $y\in V$

# Intuition/ usefullness
Hausdorff spaces are nice to work with since they can help to distinguish limits.
