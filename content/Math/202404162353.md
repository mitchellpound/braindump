# algebra ideal
For an [[202404162325|algebra]] $A$, a subset $B \subset A$ is called an **ideal** if 
1. $B$ is a vector subspace of $A$
2. Closed under multiplication: $bc \in B$ for all $b,c \in B$. 
3.  (technically this condition means $B$ is a left ideal) 
 $$
ab \in B \qquad \forall a \in A, b \in B
$$
4.  (technically this condition means $B$ is a right ideal) 
 $$
ba \in B \qquad \forall a \in A, b \in B
$$

# generating ideals
For a subset $S \subset A$, the ideal of $A$ generated by $S$ is 
$$
\langle S \rangle \coloneqq \bigcap_{\begin{split}I \subset A \ \text{ideal} \\ \text{s.t.}  \ S \subset I \end{split}} I
$$
We can think of it as the smallest ideal that contains all of $S$. 
If $S$ is not an ideal, it will have other stuff in it, but this is the "best" ideal with as little other stuff as possible. 

## Explicit construction
$\langle S \rangle$ is all finite $A$-linear combos of elements of $S$. 
$$
\langle S \rangle = \left\{\sum_{j=1}^n a_jb_j \ \bigg| n \in \mathbb{Z}^+, a_j \in A, b_j \in S\right\}
$$
