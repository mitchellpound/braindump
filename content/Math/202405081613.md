# Stabilizer under group action
Let $G$ be a [[202403121554|group]] that [[202405081540|acts]] on a set $X$. 
For $x \in X$, the stabilizer is 
$$G_x = \{g \in G \ | \ gx = x\}$$

The stabilizer is all group elements that _stabilize_ $x$ in the sense that they don't move it around under the group action. 
# Notes
- If the action is [[202405081605|free]] then $G_x = \{e\}$. 
- The stabilizer of any element $G_x$ is a subgroup of $G$.
