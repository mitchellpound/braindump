# diffeomorphism

A [[20231222092807-homeomorphism|homeomorphism]] that is a smooth (infinitely differentiable) map with a smooth inverse.
This has to be between $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ related vector spaces since we know how to do derivatives in those spaces.

A diffeomorphism preserves structure between [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifolds]].
