# A special Poisson algebra
Given a [[202404062124|symplectic manifold]] $(M, \omega)$, we can define a [[202405231236|Poisson bracket]] on the smooth functions $C^\infty(M)$ as
$$ \{f,g\} = \omega(X_f, X_g)$$
for smooth functions $f,g \in C^\infty(M)$ and their [[202405231223|Hamiltonian vector fields]] $X_f, X_g$ respectively. 

This can be restated (with a little bit of work) using the [[202405222331|Lie derivative]] as
$$ \{F,G\} = \mathcal{L}_{X_f}G$$
# Poisson commuting functions
If $f,g \in C^\infty(M)$ [[202405281427|Poisson commute]], i.e. $\{f,g\}=0$, then
- $f$ is constant on [[202405081528|integral curves]] of $X_{g}$
- $g$ is constant on integral curves of $X_{f}$.
