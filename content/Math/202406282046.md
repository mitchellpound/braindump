# Overview
A frame is informally a "basis" for a vector bundle, specifically the [[202403092141|tangent bundle]] using [[202404011135|vector fields]]. 

# Definition
A **local frame** for a [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]] $M$ defined on $U\subset M$ is a set of [[202404011135|vector fields]] $(E_1, \dots, E_n)$ that is linearly independent and spans $TU$. 

It is called a **global frame** if $U = M$.
