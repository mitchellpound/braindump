# Zariski topology
The **Zariski topology** is a [[20231220133911-topology|topological space]] $(\mathbb{C}^n, \tau)$ with closed sets $\{V(I)\}$ which are the [[202404171121|vanishing loci]] of [[202404162353|algebra ideals]] of $\mathbb{C}[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ 

(though this can be done for $\mathbb{F}^n$ for an [[202404171126|algebraically closed field]]).
