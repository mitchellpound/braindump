# metric

# Overview
This is a general way to describe the "distance" between points in a space.
Many spaces come with their own metrics or with cannonical ones that are always used.

# Definition
For a set X a metric is a function $d:X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ such that
1. $d(x,y) \geq 0$ and equality only holds when $x = y$ (positive definite)
2. $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$ (symmetric)
3. Triangle inequality $d(x,y) + d(y,z) \geq d(x,z)$
