# Rank of smooth map

## Definition of Rank
For a [[202405021216|smooth map]] $F:M \to N$ on [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifolds]] with charts (centered at $x$ and $F(x)$) like listed above, the $\text{rank}_x(F)$ is the rank of the Jacobian matrix
$$D_{\phi(x)}(\psi \circ F\circ \phi):\mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n.$$

### Set of max rank
The set of points in $M$ that has maximum rank is open. 
Also, the rank operator $rank:M \to \mathbb{Z}$ that sends $x \mapsto \text{rank}_x(F)$ is lower semi-continuous. 
That means that there is an open neighborhood $U$ around any point $x_0$ such that $\text{rank}_x(F) \geq  \text{rank}_{x_0}(F)$ for $x \in U$. 

Note the max rank is either a [[202405021547|submersion]] or [[202405021557|immersion]] depending on the dimensions of the domain or codomain. 
#### Proof
Let $\text{rank}_{x_0}(F) = k$ then the Jacobian $D_{\phi(x_0)}$ has rank $k$ so there is some $k \times k$ sub matrix (or some $k \times k$ minor) that is invertible. 
Thus, by continuity of determinant, there is an open neighborhood of the matrix that is also invertible and an open neighborhood $V \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ such that the Jacobian in invertible. 
So, following this back up the chart (which also is continuous) we can find the open set $U = \phi^{-1}(V)$. 

# Notes
We can define rank using the [[202403092121|differential]] which I find to be a little easier to understand.
