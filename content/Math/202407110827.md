# Definition
Let $X$ be a [[20231222084115-topological_basis|topological basis]] and $A \subset X$ be a subspace. 
A continuous map $r:X \to A$ is a **retract** if the restriction to $A$ is the identity map. 

Written other ways, 

$$r\big|_A = id_A$$

or 

$$r \circ \iota = id_A$$

of finally 

$$r(a) = a \qquad \forall a \in A.$$
