# symplectic manifold
A **symplectic manifold** is a pair $(M, \omega)$ where $M$ is a [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]] and $\omega$ is a [[202404061628|differential 2-form]] ($\omega \in \Omega_M^2$) such that 
1. $\omega$ is non-degenerate (pointwise). i.e. for every $p \in M$, $\omega(p) \in {\bigwedge}^2(T_p^*M)$ is non-degenerate as a bilinear form on $T_pM$. 
2. $\omega$ is closed (i.e. $d\omega = 0$). 

# Morphisms
A morphism in the category of symplectic manifolds is a [[202405230016|symplectomorphism]].
