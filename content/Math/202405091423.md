# 1-parameter subgroup
For a [[202405061454|Lie group]] $G$, a **1-parameter subgroup** is a [[202405061454#Morphisms|Lie group morphism]] 
$$
\gamma:\mathbb{R} \longrightarrow G
$$

## Notes
- By definition, $\gamma$ is a smooth [[202405081514|curve]] on $G$. 
- The set of all 1-parameter subgroups is not a subgroup itself, however, the image of $\gamma$ is a subgroup. 
- $\gamma$ does not need to be injective. 

# Correspondence between integral curves
Note that simply from the definition, 1-parameter subgroups are not [[202405081528|integral curves]]. 
However, we can show that there is a strong correspondence between them 1-parameter subgroups and integral curves of [[202405081440|left-invariant vector fields]]. 

## Proposition 1
The unique integral curve $\gamma_X$ of $X$ with initial condition $\gamma_X(0) = e$ is a 1-parameter subgroup. 
### Proof
Let $\Phi$ be the [[202405081538|flow]] generated by $X$. 
Then by we know that $\Phi_{t_1 + t_2} = \Phi_{t_1}\Phi_{t_2}$ so looking at $\Phi^{(e)}= \gamma_X$ we see that it is a 1-parameter subgroup

## Proposition 2
If $\gamma$ is a 1-parameter subgroup, then it is the integral curve of a left-invariant vector field. 
### Proof
We know that $\Phi_t(g) = g\gamma(-t)$ is a flow (we need the minus sign to ensure that it is a _left_ action). 
Note that 
$$
h\Phi_t(g) = h(g\gamma(-t)) = hg(\gamma(-t)) = \Phi_t(hg)
$$
So the flow commutes with left multiplication so it is the flow of a left invariant vector field.  
Take the integral curve of $\Phi_{-t}(e) = \gamma(t)$ to finish the proof.
