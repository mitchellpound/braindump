# Definition
For a [[202404171457|ring]] $R$, a **left (right) ideal** $I \subset R$ is a subset which is a subgroup with respect to $+$ and satisfies 
$$
ri \in I \ (\text{resp. }\ ir \in I )\qquad \forall i \in I \text{ and } r \in R
$$

A **(two-sided) ideal** is a subset that is both a left and a right ideal.


> [!NOTE] 
> We do NOT requite that ideals contain $1_R$ (unlike subrings) since if $1_R \in I$ then $I = R$. 

# Generated ideals
Given a ring $R$ and a subset $\{x_i\}_{i \in I}$, the **left ideal generated by $\{x_i\}_{i \in I}$** is the ideal 
$$
\left\{\sum_{i \in I \ \text{finite}} r_i \cdot x_i \ | \ r_i \in R\right\}
$$
The right ideal generated by a subset can be defined analogously. 

The **ideal generated by $\{x_i\}_{i \in I}$** (often denoted $(x_i)_{i \in I}$ ) is the subset 
$$
\left\{\sum_{i \in I \ \text{finite}} r_i \cdot x_i \cdot s_i \ | \ r_i,s_i \in R\right\}
$$
# Important types of ideals
For an ideal $I \subset R$:

$I$ is **principal** if it is generated by a single element. 
That is, if $I = (r)$ for some $r \in R$. 

$I$ is **finitely generated** if $I = (r_1, \dots, r_n)$ for some (finite) $r_1, \dots, r_n \in R$. 

$I \subsetneq R$ is **maximal** if for any other ideal $J$ such that $I \subseteq J$, then $J = R$ or $J = I$. 

$I \subset R$ is prime if whenever $ab \in I$ for $a,b \in R$ then either $a \in I$ or $b \in I$. 

## Relation to quotient
An ideal $I \subset R$ is maximal if and only if $R\big/I$ is a [[202404171508|field]]. 

An ideal $I \subset R$ is prime if and only if $R\big/I$ is an [[202409172236|integral domain]].
