# random variable

For a [[20240213222154-probability_space|probability space]] $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$, a function $X: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \to (\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B})$ is called a random variable if it is a [[20231218115927-measureable_function|measureable function]].
Note here $\mathcal{B}$ is the [[20231218115557-borel_sigma_algebra]]  on the real numbers.
This is important, because we want random variables to be real-valued. Also, the Borel $\sigma$ -algebra has some very nice properties to use.

A set of random variables $\{X_1, \dots, X_n \}$ is called a *random vector*.
