# weak product
For a collection of [[202403121554|groups]] $\{G_i\}_{i\in I}$, the **weak product** is the group $G$ whose elements are $(g_i)_{i\in I}$ such that $g_i \in G_i$ and $g_i = e$ (the identity element in that group) for almost all $i$ and the group multiplication is componentwise. 

Note: Depending on what properties you want from the product, you can consider $g_i = e$ for all but finitely entries.
