The general linear group is one of the most important [[202403121554|groups]] in group theory. 

Not only is $\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{R})$ one of the first groups people encounter, it comes built in with a lot of matrix theory. 
In addition, it is a [[202405061454|Lie group]]. 
# Definition
For $\mathbb{F}^n$ for some [[202404171508|field]] $\mathbb{F}$, the group of invertible $n \times n$ matrices is called the **general linear group** denoted

$$ \text{GL}(n, \mathbb{F}) \subset \text{Mat}_{n \times n}(\mathbb{F})$$

For an arbitrary vector space $V$, 
$$ \text{GL}(V) = \{\varphi \in \text{End}(V) \ | \ \varphi \ \text{is invertible} \} $$
# Group structure
We can take group multiplication to be composition, which for matrices in $\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{F})$ this is simply matrix multiplication. 

# Lie group structure
We know that $\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{R})$ and $\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{C})$ are both open subsets of $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{C})$ respectively, since (informally) we can "wiggle" the entries of an invertible matrix by a small epsilon and still have an invertible matrix.

More formally, the determinant function is continuous, so $\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{F}) = \det^{-1}\big((-\infty, 0)\cup (0, \infty)\big)$ is open, so thus it is an open submanifold of $\text{Mat}_{n\times n}(\mathbb{F})$.

For matrix multiplication as the group operation, then we see that it is continuous, since matrix multiplication is a polynomial of entries of the matrix.
So $\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{R})$ is a Lie group
## Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(n, \mathbb{R})$, $\mathfrak{gl}(n, \mathbb{C})$
Let $\mathfrak{gl}(n, \mathbb{R})$ ($\mathfrak{gl}(n, \mathbb{C})$) denote the [[202405062209|Lie algebra]] of $\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{R})$ ($\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{C})$ respectively).

$$ \mathfrak{gl}(n, \mathbb{R}) = \text{Mat}_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R}) \qquad \text{and } \qquad \mathfrak{gl}(n, \mathbb{C}) = \text{Mat}_{n \times n}(\mathbb{C})$$
