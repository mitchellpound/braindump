# The exponential map
For a [[202405061454|Lie group]] $G$ with [[202405081415|Lie algebra]] $\mathfrak{g}$, the **exponential map** is 
$$
\begin{split}\exp:\mathfrak{g} &\longrightarrow G \\
\xi &\longmapsto \gamma^\xi(1)
\end{split}
$$
where $\gamma^\xi(t)$ is the [[202405091423|1-parameter subgroup]] with ${\gamma^\xi}^\prime(0)=\xi$. 

In other words, to find the exponential map, we take an element of the Lie algebra, and we convert it to the [[202405081440|left-invariant vector field]] $X^\xi$. 
Then we can take the [[202405081538|flow]] generated by $X^\xi$ and look at $\Phi^{(e)}(1)$ which is the [[202405081528|integral curve]] starting at $\gamma(0) = e$ with $\gamma^\prime(0) = \xi$ and evaluate it at $1$. 

# Why 1?
Why do we evaluate on the somewhat arbitrary seeming number $1$? 

It comes from the property of [[202405091423|1-parameter subgroup]] as integral curves for left-invariant vector fields. 
We know that 
$$
\gamma^{s\xi}(t) = \gamma^\xi(st)
$$
Where $\gamma^{s\xi}$ is the integral curve starting at $e$ for a left invariant vector field identified by an element $\xi \in \mathfrak{g}$ .

So if we use this formula and evaluate where $s=1$ then we get 
$$
\gamma^\xi(t) = \exp(t\xi)
$$
Thus, the exponential function traces out integral curves of left-invariant vector fields that go through the identity element of the Lie group. 
We can write flows in terms of the exponential map. 
The flow $\Phi_{\xi}$ which is the flow of $\xi^L$, the left-invariant vector field corresponding to $\xi$ is
$$
\Phi(t,g) = g \exp(-t\xi) \qquad \forall t \in \mathbb{R}, g \in G
$$

# Properties
- If $[\xi, \eta] = 0$ then $\exp(\xi + \eta) = \exp(\xi)\exp(\eta)$ 
- The exponential map respects Lie group homomorphisms.

- For a [[202405091602|matrix Lie algebra]], the exponential map is the [[202405091601|matrix exponential]] (proof [[202405091601#Proof|here]]).
