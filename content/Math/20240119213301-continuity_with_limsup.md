# continuity with limsup

Define the functions

$$
H(x) = \inf_{\delta > 0} \sup_{|y-x|< \delta} f(y)
$$ 
and

$$
h(x) = \sup_{\delta > 0} \inf_{|y-x|< \delta} f(y)
$$

Then f is continuous at x iff $h(x) = H(x)$.

Note: This is an analysis proof, so we are talking about $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology
