# Interior product
The interior product is a way to go "down" a degree of a [[202404061628|differential form]] 
(As opposed to the [[202403291458|exterior derivative]] which goes "up" a degree). 
Thus, for a [[202404011135|vector field]] $X$, 
$$\iota_X: \Omega^p \longrightarrow \Omega^{p-1}.$$

It is defined by holding the first spot of the differential form constant by the vector field and leaving all the others to vary. 
More formally, 
$$\iota_X \alpha = \alpha(X, -, \dots, -) $$
or even more formally, 
$$\iota_X\alpha(X_1, \dots, X_{p-1}) = \alpha(X, X_1, \dots, X_{p-1}).$$

# Notation
Some authors use the notation 
$$X \ \lrcorner \ \alpha = \iota_X\alpha$$
