# closure of set
For a [[20231220133911-topology|topological space]] $(X, \tau)$ and a subset $A \subset X$ the closure of A is the intersection of all closed sets containing A (i.e $A \subset C$)

Its important to note that the closure of a set is always closed, and that it will always contain the [[20240104114428-interior_or_set|interior of the set]].
