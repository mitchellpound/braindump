# Related vector fields
Given a [[202405021216|smooth map]] $F:M \to N$ on [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifolds]], we know that the [[202403092121|differential]] maps
$$ dF_p:T_pM \longrightarrow T_{F(p)}N.$$
However, we don't know that this is a "nice" mapping between tangent spaces. 
F is not guaranteed to be either injective or surjective. 
So if we have a vector space $X \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$ then we don't know if we can get a vector field $Y \in \mathfrak{X}(N)$ using $F$ since maybe it would not map a vector to $T_{F(p)}Y$. 

# Definition
Two vector fields $X \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$ and $Y \in \mathfrak{X}(N)$ are called **F-related** if 
$$dF_p(X_p)= Y_{F(p)}$$

# Conditions
$X$ and $Y$ are $F$-related if and only if for every smooth (real-valued) function $f$ defined on an open subset of $N$,
$$ X(f\circ F) = Y(f) \circ F.$$
## Proof
#todo
