# Statement
Let $(M, \sigma)$ be a [[202406241434|Poisson manifold]], and let $x \in M$.
There exists coordinates $(U, p_{1}, \dots, p_{s}, q^{1}, \dots, q^{s}, y_{1}, \dots, y_{k})$ centered at $x$ such that

$$
\sigma\big|_{U} = \sum_{i=1}^{s}\frac{\partial}{\partial p_{i}} \wedge \frac{\partial}{\partial q^{i}} + \sum_{1 \leq a \leq b \leq k}\theta^{ab}(y) \frac{\partial}{\partial y^{a}} \wedge \frac{\partial}{\partial y^{b}}
$$

where $2s = \text{rank } \sigma_{x}$ and $\theta^{ab}(y)$ are smooth functions of $(y_{1}, \dots, y_{k})$ such that $\theta^{ab}(0) = 0$.

## Proof

# Notes
This means that we can shrink the open set small enough so that the local structure of the Poisson manifold under the Weinstein splitting chart $\phi$ becomes

$$ \phi(U) = V \times W, \qquad \text{where } V \subset \mathbb{R}^{2s}, W \subset \mathbb{R}^{k}.$$

Thus, the charts give local Poisson isomorphisms

$$\phi: (U, \sigma|_{U}) \longrightarrow (V, \sigma_{\text{can}}) \times (W, \theta)$$

Where $\sigma_{\text{can}}$ is the canonical Poisson bracket on $\mathbb{R}^{2s}$ with coordinates $(p_{1}, \dots, p_{s}, q_{1}, \dots, q_{s})$ which is given by

$$ \{f, g\} \coloneqq \sum_{i}^{s} \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial p^{i}}\frac{\partial g}{\partial q^{i}} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial q^{i}}\frac{\partial g}{\partial p^{i}}\right)$$

and

$$\theta = \sum_{a<b} \theta^{ab}(y) \frac{\partial}{\partial y^{a}} \wedge \frac{\partial}{\partial y^{b}}.$$

The important thing to notice is that this Poisson structure vanishes at the point $y = 0$.

The first chart on $V$ gives a result that is very close to the standard symplectic form that comes from [[202406282200|Darboux charts]] on a [[202404062124|symplectic manifold]].

The second structure that is defined on $W$ shows that we can "squish" the manifold to a place where the "rest" of the bivector doesn't do anything at the point where it is centered at.
Thus, we can safely make a submanifold, since the Poisson structure vanishes, leaving only the canonical structure.
