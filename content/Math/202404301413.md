# radical ideal
An [[202404162353|algebra ideal]] $I$ is called **radical** if for an element $a \in A$, $a^n \in I$ then $a \in I$ for some integer $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.  

If a higher power is in the ideal, then the element itself is in the ideal. 

Note, if $I$ is radical, then the quotient $A/I$ is [[202404301425|reduced]].
