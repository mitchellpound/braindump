# Overview
The Excision Theorem is a result from [[202407082223|singular homology]] where "deleting" a "small enough" subspace (of a subspace) doesn't affect the [[202407100953|relative homology]]. 

# Statement
Let $(X, A)$ be a [[202407100948|pair]] and $U \subset X$ such that $\overline{U} \subset \text{int}(A)$. 
Then there is an isomorphism 

$$H_\bullet(X\backslash U, A \backslash U) \simeq H_\bullet(X, A)$$

induced by the inclusion of pairs 

$$(X\backslash U, A \backslash U) \hookrightarrow (X,A)$$

# Proof
#todo - This is pretty hard and involved. Need argument about baricentric subdivision.
