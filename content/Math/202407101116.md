# Overview
A homotopy group is a higher dimension generalization of the [[202406180947|fundamental group]]. 
Instead of looking at equivalence classes of loops (i.e. $\gamma:I \to X$) then you look at homotopy classes of "higher dimension" loops i.e. $I^n \to X$. 

Usually these are VERY hard to compute.
