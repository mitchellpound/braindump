# Definition
## Decomposition
This definition comes from [[@sjamaar1991Stratified]]. 

 Let $X$ be a [[20240104115847-hausdorff_space|Hausdorff]], paracompact [[20231220133911-topology|topological space]] (as I am mainly concerned with [[202403052130|manifolds]]) and let $I$ be an indexing set that is partially ordered (we will denote the order relations using $\leq$ ).
A [[202410012200|locally finite]] collection of disjoint, locally closed manifolds $X_i \subset X$ is called an **$I$-decomposition** if 

1. $X = \bigcup_{i \in I} X_i$

2. $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ satisfies the [[202410012207|frontier condition]], that respects the partial ordering. That is, 
$$ 
X_i \cap \overline {X_j} \neq \emptyset \Longleftrightarrow X_i \subset \overline{X_j} \Longleftrightarrow i \leq j
$$
Note that if $X_i \subset \overline X_j$, then we write $X_i \leq X_j$. 
Similarly, if $X_i \leq X_j$ and $X_i \neq X_j$ then we write $X_i < X_j$. 

We can define the dimension of a decomposed space $X$ to be 
$$
\dim X = \sup_{i\in I} \dim X_i
$$
## Depth
We can then define the **depth** of a **stratum** (piece) $X_i$ as 
$$
\text{depth}_XX_i = \sup\{n \ | \  \text{there exists pieces} X_i < X_{i,1} < \dots < X_{i,n} \}
$$
Said another way, the depth of a piece, is how many other pieces it "fits into" respecting the $I$ grading (how many layers of subspaces there are over the piece). 

If we look at the [[202410012247|cone]] over $X$, $\text{cone}(X)$, then it can be broken up into two parts: the "cone part" and the boundary, which is $X$. 
Thus, 
$$
\text{depth}\big(\text{cone}(X)\big) = \text{depth}(X) +1.
$$

## Stratified space
We can use this to define a stratified space:
A decomposition of $X$ is called a **stratification** (and thus $X$ is a **stratified space**) if the strata satisfy the following condition:
For each $x \in X_i \subset X$, there exists an open neighborhood $U \subset X_i$ of $x$, and a stratified space $L$ (called the **link** of $x$) and a homeomorphism to some subspace $V \subset X$ containing $x$ such that
$$
\varphi: U \times \text{cone}(L) \longrightarrow V \subset X
$$
preserves the decomposition.
