# Definition
Given a [[20231220133911-topology|topological space]] $X$, the cone over $X$ is the topological space 
$$
\text{cone}(X) \coloneqq [0, \infty) \times X \big/ (\{0\} \times X).
$$

# Notes
This is the [[20240113171045-quotient_topology|quotient topology]] given that we map all the points on the "bottom" of the interval to the same point. 

Another way to think about this is that for the space $X$, when we product with an interval, we get a "cylinder" of the space $X$. 
The cone takes and "crushed" one side of the cylinder all down to a single point.
